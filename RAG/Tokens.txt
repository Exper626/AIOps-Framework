 Annual Report 2021 | 17
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to report that Sri Lanka 
Telecom Group recorded a stellar 
performance delivering earnings 
growth of 54% to Rs.12.2 Bn in 
2021. Its balance sheet strengthened 
recording asset growth of 8% to 
Rs.220 Bn and equity growth of 11% 
to 93.9 Bn in 2021. More importantly, 
its relevance to the country’s 
socioeconomic progress continues to 
grow as we reach more subscribers 
with our unified brand value 
proposition while fulfilling our role as 
a catalyst for the digital transformation 
of the country at individual and 
enterprise levels. 
On the negative side, the super gain 
tax proposed by the government 
will dent our profitability and cash 
flows. Nevertheless, as a responsible 
corporate we shall bear this in the 
hope it will help tide over the critical 
economic issues faced by the nation.   
A SUCCESS STORY
Sri Lanka Telecom is the success 
story for privatization in the state 
sector. It has recorded strong growth 
in earnings post privatization while 
expanding its pivotal role in the 
digital evolution of the country. Listed 
in CSE with a govt holding of not 
more than 49.5%, we are currently 
in discussions for further dilution of 
equity as specified under listing rules 
to meet main board requirements. SLT 
market capitalisation of over Rs.70 Bn 
representing approximately 1.5% of 
the market capitalisation of the CSE is 
backed by a strong domestic franchise 
that has gained strength with the 
brand unification implemented  
in 2021.
In January 2020, we saw a company 
with immense potential, but its 
progress was obstructed in several 
areas. Staff unrest was at the top of 
the list with regular strikes and work 
stoppages leading to poor messaging 
to the customers especially, the 
corporate sector. There were also 
significant investments made but 
without the desired ROI. These 
were some of the key challenges 
the new Board addressed and took 
result-oriented steps to take SLT to 
a new era of growth and resource 
optimisation. The excellent financial 
results posted this year is the success 
of these deliberations during 2021.
A BLUEPRINT FOR GROWTH
The outcome of the first board 
meeting was a blueprint for unlocking 
value to realise the potential of this 
nationally significant institution. I am 
happy to see that the early initiatives 
implemented in 2020 stabilised the 
company and enabled its move to 
the top of the ladder in 2021. The 
consolidation of Group companies 
under a Group CEO in 2020, was 
further enhanced with all main 
functions of HR, Finance, Legal and 
Brand Marketing being brought under 
the group umbrella for a unified and 
focused strategic direction. 
The unified brand SLT-MOBITEL 
launched on the first working day of 
January 2021 was key to unlocking 
value and realizing Group synergies. 
We were able to achieve this in a cost-
effective manner as it was done within 
the process of the advertising pitch 
presented by all reputed advertising 
agencies in Sri Lanka. By channelling 
the entire group advertising through 
one agency after a successful pitch, we 
were able to manage costs effectively. 
The core principles, zero corruption, 
minimum wastage, maximum 
efficiency and inclusive management 
the new Board introduced in the 
beginning of 2020, are now firmly 
embedded in the governance code 
of operations. These helped in 
building confidence between the 
staff and the management and the 
adoption of new strategies. These 
critical changes made Sri Lanka 
Telecom the most powerful player 
in the telecommunications sector 
in the country with the broadest 
presence across the value chain 
and unparalleled capacity to meet 
the needs of up-and-coming tech 
companies, large corporates, general 
public and the state institutions.
UNLOCKING VALUE
Sri Lanka Telecom is an asset rich 
company with a fast majority in 
Property Plant & Equipment, In 
addition to considerable investments 
in technology. SLT real estate portfolio 
listed in the Annual Report is being 
reviewed for monetizing through 
strategic partnerships. The Company 
is confident of a good revenue from 
this exercise and hopes to create a 
new revenue line of approximately 
500 million per annum soon. 
The brand unification launched in in 
the beginning of 2021 supported the 
“One stop shop” concept which is 
now being implemented throughout 
the country. This enabled the Group 
to save rental expenses through the 
consolidation of operations under 
one roof. It also showcased the full 
spectrum of services and devices and 
enhanced the customer experience. 
For the next level of customer 
convenience, we are focusing on bill 
convergence for which approval from 
the Telecom Regulatory Commission 
is awaited. Additionally, the role out 
of 5G technology will be available for 
experience in selected outlets. 
UPHOLDING TRUST
Sri Lanka Telecom upheld the 
country’s trust during the past two 
years as we all navigated perhaps 
the most challenging period in living 
memory. As the pandemic changed 
the way we work, learn and live, 
telecommunication was the lifeline for 
those who were sick, in quarantine or 
in need of comfort. Despite the health 
and safety challenges to our teams 
and the business disruptions, Sri Lanka 
Telecom upheld the trust of an entire 
nation providing an uninterrupted 
service and supporting the migration 
of thousands of businesses and 
people to digital platforms. It is hard 
to think of how we, as a nation, could 
have managed to maintain even the 
subdued levels of economic activity 
since the pandemic without this iconic 
company upholding its promise. 
The leadership strategized to 
overcome the multiple challenges and 
our field staff worked in the front lines 
at considerable risk to provide new 
connections and address complaints, 
all united by a sense of purpose. 
Throughout this period, our staff 
remained motivated and national 
minded while effective engagement 
with trade unions supported business 
continuity throughout this critical 
period. It is important to note that 
we maintained our prices throughout 
18 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
this period to ensure that our services 
remained affordable to our customers, 
making Sri Lanka one of the cheapest 
countries for telecommunication 
services.
We needed to rewrite the book 
on managing the pandemic as we 
continued to be dogged by variants 
and waves in 2021 despite extensive 
vaccinations. Cybersecurity was a key 
concern as we also had a threat on 
ransomware. Managing these twin 
threats made business continuity 
planning a priority and significant 
time and resources were allocated 
to strengthening our defenses and 
response mechanisms. A vigilance 
committee was established which met 
weekly to assess the situation and 
address the issues. Sri Lanka Telecom 
upheld its trust with its employees as 
we implemented several measures 
for their safety and that of their 
families. Our holiday bungalows were 
converted to quarantine facilities 
for staff and their families. We also 
booked space at specialised care 
centres managed by hospitals for 
employees who needed additional 
care. We also provided dry rations 
for employees who tested positive 
and their families. A Group wide 
campaign to vaccinate our staff 
enabled us to get 90% of our staff 
vaccinated with two doses and now 
the booster is being administered 
to safeguard them. Employees also 
had access to medical advice through 
our e-channelling service. Sri Lanka 
Telecom was the first to contribute 
to the COVID fund as well. We are 
now able to move forward as a more 
resilient Group with an enhanced 
employee value proposition and 
the readiness to meet unforeseen 
challenges.
INTEGRATING ESG
Sri Lanka Telecom is committed to 
integrating ESG best practices into its 
business model, making it an essential 
part of our operating structure. A 
large energy bill provides strong 
motivation to formulate a holistic, 
long-term response and we will 
continue to seek solutions to reduce 
our energy consumption. Expansion 
of our fiber network coverage will 
support a decrease in our carbon 
footprint and reduce the MSAN 
impact. Solar, wind, hydro and other 
renewable energy options are being 
evaluated to facilitate our transition to 
low carbon and renewable sources of 
energy. 
SLT commenced its campaign to 
plant Mee trees (Madhuca Longifolia) 
islandwide under the ESG protocols 
to improve environment, empower 
underprivileged villages and govern 
the program through KPI’s including 
geo tagging the plants and their 
ownership. Mee is an indigenous tree 
with natural pest control properties 
and contributes to fertilizing the 
soil and purifying the air. It is a 
historically significant tree as etched 
in our ancient stone tablets. This is 
an example of our commitment to 
finding sustainable solutions through 
knowledge, nature and science 
aligned with our culture and heritage. 
The campaign will run over a few 
years and expand to other valuable 
tree species with an aim of exceeding 
million plants and earn carbon credit 
for the Company.
Integration of ESG into our systems 
and processes and the work culture 
rallies all to work beyond profit. Sri 
Lanka Telecom plays a key role in 
inclusive progress for all Sri Lankans 
as connectivity empowers them 
to access a host of services and 
improve their lifestyle. Connecting 
rural villages through the “Gamata 
Sannivedanaya” programme is an 
example of our vision of empowering 
Sri Lankans to participate effectively 
in the socioeconomic progress of our 
country. Other social aspects include 
providing digital access to health and 
other common services especially 
the “connect schools” program 
through our fibre optic backbone 
for uninterrupted connectivity for 
advanced education as an alternative 
to tuition. 
NAVIGATING 2022 & BEYOND
The fragile global economic recovery 
observed in 2021 received a body 
blow with the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine in March 2022. Locally, 
the country continues to struggle 
with the foreign exchange liquidity 
Sri Lanka Telecom plays 
a key role in inclusive 
progress for all Sri 
Lankans as connectivity 
empowers them to 
access a host of services 
and improve their 
lifestyle. Connecting 
rural villages through the 
“Gamata Sannivedanaya” 
programme is an 
example of our vision of 
empowering Sri Lankans 
to participate effectively 
in the socioeconomic 
progress of our country.
GROUP CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE
 Annual Report 2021 | 19
crisis and sharp devaluation of the 
rupee in March 2022 as looming 
debt repayments continue to hinder 
economic progress. It has also 
triggered a potential energy crisis 
which is a growing concern. Rising 
inflation which is a global issue 
is amplified in the local context, 
exacerbating the challenges ahead. 
We are cautiously optimistic that 
the pandemic is nearing endemicity, 
although we remain on high alert for 
developments around the world.
Our relevance to customers increased 
as we transformed from a telephone 
company to a tech company that 
is a catalyst for Sri Lanka’s digital 
transformation. We are excited about 
delivering the future today as we 
connect people with fiber network to 
their homes, creating safe wi-fi zones 
to supporting a future fit lifestyle. 
In 2021, we established “The 
Embryo”, our own research and 
development arm which stems from 
the infusion of yin and yang to give 
life to ideas. Under this, we provide 
facilities to start up tech companies 
and our own innovators who will 
develop coding and applications. 
A number of projects have been 
undertaken by “The Embryo” and we 
will see new products coming out of 
this in 2022 which will enhance our 
product range to customers and new 
applications and coding to improve 
our own systems. These innovations 
will transform our houses to smart 
homes with hither to unknown 
features. This will deliver services such 
as medical consultations, security, 
entertainment, education and also 
empower people to work and transact 
from the comfort of their homes 
facilitating a new era of smart living, 
Although we delivered reliable Wi-
Fi despite the upsurge in demand 
during the pandemic period, one of 
our issues has been the speed. This 
is being addressed by increasing 
the bandwidth with an investment 
of US$ 50 Mn from our own funds in 
a new under the sea cable together 
with a consortium of 16 telecom 
companies in the region to improve 
broadband and data services. The 
increased capacity will support the 
growth of data centres, supporting 
new employment opportunities in the 
country.
We are also enhancing our data 
centres and transforming them to data 
farms, encouraging corporates to use 
our data servers as opposed to the 
current model of operating their own 
server rooms which is an expensive 
solution. Our data farms will enable 
these corporates to reduce the cost of 
operations while retaining control over 
their information assets. This will be a 
key campaign for Sri Lanka Telecom 
in 2022.
Sri Lanka Telecom will also leverage 
its Group strength through a Group 
Treasury function to manage Group 
cashflows, reduce interest rates and 
strengthen the Group’s financial 
resilience with zero debt by 2023. We 
are pleased that we are very much on 
course towards this goal with stringent 
financial management and optimized 
use of assets.
We had a change in leadership at 
Mobitel in 2021 as Mr. Chandika 
Vithanage took over the reins. There 
was a change in leadership at Sri 
Lanka Telecom in February 2022 as 
well with Mr. Janaka Abeysinghe 
taking over as the Chief Executive. A 
new COO is also designated to take 
over in July 2022. These changes 
will also support new ideas and 
development of new capabilities 
across the Group.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
All of the above would not have 
been possible without the willing 
cooperation of key stakeholders. The 
management and the employees of 
the Sri Lanka Telecom Group have set 
an example to all utility companies 
in the country as they worked 
throughout the difficult times without 
unfair demands demonstrating the 
commitment to serve the nation and 
its people at a critical time. The Board 
joins me in commending their efforts 
and thanking them for their unstinted 
support. 
Effective leadership is a sine qua 
non for sustained growth integrating 
ESG at its core. I am grateful for the 
commitment of the Board of Directors, 
for their cooperation in this regard 
and for their support in driving the 
changes required to transform Sri 
Lanka Telecom into a resilient future 
forward technology company that can 
lead Sri Lanka trough the 5th industrial 
revolution.
All of this is possible due to a loyal 
customer base that continues to 
trust Sri Lanka Telecom for inclusion 
in the socioeconomic progress of 
the country as we empower them to 
connect locally to global opportunities 
for learning, earning and innovating. 
The Board, our teams and I are 
committed to paving the way to 
empower our customers through a 
growing portfolio of products and 
services that will support their lifestyle 
and career aspirations, taking Sri 
Lanka to a new era of growth.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER’S MESSAGE
Sri Lanka Telecom 
Group delivered a 
strong performance 
with topline growth of 
12.3% year on year to 
Rs.102.3 Bn boosted 
by 16% growth in fixed 
telephony operations 
and 9% growth in mobile 
operations.
The cornerstone of the Group’s strategy was the SLT-Mobitel brand unification which 
supported realisation of significant group synergies and the positioning of the Group as the 
National ICT solution services provider. 
 Annual Report 2021 | 21
Dear Stakeholders,
REFLECTIONS ON 2021
Digital transformation across the 
world accelerated with the onset of 
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 
continued to gather momentum in 
2021. Sri Lanka Telecom has been at 
the forefront of the country’s digital 
transformation, supporting people, 
businesses and government entities 
migrate to digital platforms for a 
growing number of applications. As 
the pandemic continued to disrupt 
economic activity in 2021 as well, 
digital platforms continued to keep 
people connected and entertained 
while supporting learning and working 
from home, significantly minimising 
its impact. Several key industries 
including banks, hospitals, the retail 
and food industries accelerated digital 
empowerment of their customers 
which supported the surge in 
e-commerce and online transactions 
in 2021 facilitating enhanced 
customer satisfaction. These initiatives 
led to significant progress of the 
Government’s vision for a digital  
Sri Lanka. 
Sri Lanka Telecom continued to invest 
in upgrading its infrastructure, paving 
the way for Sri Lanka’s integration 
into the global marketplace and the 
5th industrial revolution that we are 
living through. We are expanding our 
fibre and 5G technology networks to 
support higher speeds for all. With 
the brand unification, we focused 
on delivering integrated solutions 
combining the wide range of 
services provided by both Sri Lanka 
Telecom and Mobitel to provide total 
solutions for individual and corporate 
customers. Our integrated enterprise 
solutions are unparalleled supporting 
growth of the country’s vital IT sector 
which is key to its socioeconomic 
progress. Our investments in the  
SEA-ME-WE cables have been the 
gateway to the country’s integration 
with the world and we are now 
investing in our 6th cable enhancing 
capacity and speed which will be 
commissioned in 2022. 
A commitment to drive growth 
without corruption and waste in 
an inclusive manner supported 
the Sri Lanka Telecom Group to 
overcome significant challenges in 
2021 and increase the efficiency of 
our operations. We anticipated the 
evolution of technology before it 
transformed, and we were future 
ready in terms of infrastructure 
developments for the modern 
technology. SLT-MOBITEL now clearly 
poised as the National ICT solution 
services provider, reinforcing our 
strengths to provide an unmatched 
value proposition to individuals and 
corporates of all sizes.
GROUP STRATEGY AND VISION
The cornerstone of the Group’s 
strategy was the SLT-Mobitel brand 
unification which supported realisation 
of significant group synergies and 
the positioning of the Group as the 
National ICT solution services provider. 
These include the ability to offer 
seamlessly integrated solutions to 
customers, strengthening customer 
service and driving significant cost 
efficiencies in a number of areas. It 
also eliminated confusion of brands by 
customers who are now able to obtain 
the full range of solutions under one 
roof. 
We also divested non-core businesses 
to concentrate on our core 
businesses which has supported our 
performance during the year as we 
are now realizing the benefits through 
improved focus and productivity. 
Further, the clear definition of metrics 
and goals supported oversight 
and performance management, 
synchronizing activities towards 
organisation goals. These initiatives 
supported the SLT Group to record 
the highest turnover in its entire 
history while maintaining prices 
and ensuring that access to Wi-Fi 
remained affordable with attractively 
priced Work From Home (WFH) and 
Work From POD (WFP) packages to 
support people through the pandemic 
years.
Sri Lanka Telecom was ranked 
among the Top Ten in the country’s 
prestigious Best Corporate Citizen 
Sustainability Awards in 2021 and was 
also the winner of the Other category. 
Our efforts to support the nation 
during the pandemic were recognised 
with an award for demonstrating 
resilient practices during this period 
at the same award programme 
organised by the Ceylon Chamber of 
Commerce. 
DELIVERING PERFORMANCE
Sri Lanka Telecom Group delivered 
a strong performance with topline 
growth of 12.3% year on year to 
Rs.102.3 Bn boosted by 16% growth 
in fixed telephony operations and 
9% growth in mobile operations. 
Profit After Tax growth of 54.3% to 
Rs.12.2 Bn was largely attributable 
to the enhanced profitability of 
mobile operations which increased 
by 63.8% to Rs. 8 Bn accounting for 
66% of Group Profits after tax while 
profitability from fixed telephony 
operations increased by 46% to  
Rs. 5.9 Bn accounting for the balance. 
EBITDA of the Group grew at 16.1% 
to Rs. 41.17 Bn supporting a high 
level of liquidity and strong cashflow 
generation.
Group profits were propelled forward 
by robust performances by multiple 
business segments, improving 
financial resilience through improved 
diversification of revenues. 2021 
saw a surge in broadband revenues 
supported by increased connections 
and usage. Revenue growth in PEO 
TV was also encouraging as more 
consumers sought broader menus for 
entertainment. We also strengthened 
our value proposition to global 
businesses with Xyntac, the Group’s 
evolving digital communications 
ecosystem that has the capability 
to provide transport speeds upto 
multiple speeds of 100 Gbps through 
ownership of major submarine cable 
systems and partner cable systems. 
Financial resilience was further 
improved with the decrease of 
Rs.8.5 Bn in borrowings during the 
year under review which was also 
supported by an increase of 11% in 
equity to Rs.93.9 Bn. Accordingly, 
the debt equity ratio improved from 
78.2% in 2020 to 66.1% in 2021. 
Liquidity of the Group also improved 
as operating cashflows recorded an 
increase of 35% to Rs.43.6 Bn. We 
invested Rs.30 Bn in new technologies 
and enhancing our capabilities 
in 2021, a near doubling of the 
investments made in 2020 enhancing 
our revenue generation capabilities. 
22 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
Cash and cash equivalents at the close 
of the year increased by 63% to Rs.16 
Bn providing sufficient liquidity while 
the overall financial position provides 
sufficient headroom for pursuit of our 
strategic goals to drive sustainable 
growth in earnings. 
I am pleased to report that the market 
capitalisation of Sri Lanka Telecom 
PLC increased by 15.8% to Rs. 70 Bn  
during the reporting period, reflecting 
the shareholder value created in 2021. 
VALUE DELIVERED TO 
EMPLOYEES
People strategy was critical to 
alignment of employee and 
organisational objectives and to 
the realisation of synergies through 
the brand unification. The more 
inclusive and participative style of 
management adopted from 2020 with 
the absorption of outsourced staff into 
the permanent cadre worked well and 
the trade unions cooperated to ensure 
business continuity throughout the 
pandemic lockdown periods. In 2021, 
we enhanced the performance culture 
by introducing a performance based 
bonus linked to the performance 
management system, a supervisor 
peer evaluation system and a research 
and development platform to 
capture employee ideas, enhancing 
recognition and rewards. We also 
launched a Regional Awakening 
initiative to empower the regions 
under the General and Deputy 
General Managers to ensure that 
progress benefited those who served 
around the country as well. 
The holistic care program 
implemented for employees during 
the pandemic included the conversion 
of the three holiday homes into 
quarantine centres, reserving space 
with intermediary care centres and 
provision of dry rations for infected 
employees and their families. Capacity 
building has been a key area of focus 
with employees receiving 8 hours of 
training on average which we plan 
to increased to 12 in the coming 
year. A retention rate of 95% affirms 
the strength of our employee value 
proposition with many employees 
encouraging the next generation to 
join in as well.
FORMULATING OUR CLIMATE 
AGENDA
Sri Lanka Telecom commenced 
its journey towards becoming a 
carbon neutral organisation in 
2018. Phase I to assess the carbon 
footprint and obtain ISO certification 
has been completed and we are 
now in Phase II, which focuses on 
energy management and policy 
implementation. Several projects are 
being rolled out across the Group to 
mitigate carbon emissions as a unified 
brand. We are now in the process of 
setting up a timeframe with external 
consultants to reach our goal in 5 
years. Apart from this, we continue 
to increase awareness on the urgent 
need to preserve the environment and 
reduce environmental degradation. 
Minimising waste was a key dimension 
with initiatives to convert waste to 
cash supporting cost efficiencies. 
As the only provider of fibre-to-the-
home connectivity in Sri Lanka, we 
have begun replacing traditional 
copper cables with modern fibre optic 
cables for high speed internet across 
the country. We then completely 
repurpose those copper cables 
for traditional operations, reusing 
resources that would otherwise have 
been discarded as waste.  Mee Tree 
planting campaign is another project 
which will support offsetting carbon 
emissions and has the potential to 
create a revenue stream by generating 
carbon credits. A dedicated 
Power and energy department is 
implementing plans to diversify our 
energy sources through investments 
in renewable energy such as solar and 
biomass.  
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S MESSAGE
Sri Lanka Telecom is 
transforming from a 
Telecommunications 
company to a Technology 
company as we broaden 
the customer value 
propositions for different 
customer segments, 
delivering the future 
today. We will expand 
our 4G network beyond 
40% and also activate 5G 
in 2022. 
 Annual Report 2021 | 23
DELIVERING THE FUTURE
The increasing reliance on digital 
platforms to support lifestyles and 
how we do business underpins 
our plans for growth. Despite the 
uncertain economic landscape, there 
has been no abatement of the pace of 
technology evolution and we observe 
an acceleration as there is increasing 
acceptance and understanding of 
the benefits. Regulation of the sector 
continues to evolve and our position 
as a National ICT Provider ensures that 
we are engaged in the discussion and 
are cognizant of the multidimensional 
socioeconomic impacts of this rapidly 
evolving industry.
Sri Lanka Telecom is transforming from 
a Telecommunications company to a 
Technology company as we broaden 
the customer value propositions 
for different customer segments, 
delivering the future today. We will 
expand our 4G network beyond 40% 
and also activate 5G in 2022. Our fibre 
network will be expanded as well, 
using Fibre to the roof technology to 
ensure it is safe and a viable option. 
Investing in the SEA-ME-WE 6, the 
newest undersea able running across 
the globe will be key to improving 
global connectivity. Ensuring our 
customers are part of our journey is 
key and we are planning to introduce 
affordable 4G devices through our 
joint venture which will do local 
assembly.  
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Everyone played a part in delivering 
the outstanding performance set out 
in this report. I commence by thanking 
my team and the CEOs who led the 
teams to deliver on multifaceted 
strategies despite the challenges. 
I am also grateful for the direction 
and guidance provided by the Board 
which was available for counsel when 
needed. We thank the Sri Lanka 
Telecommunications Regulatory 
Commission who continued their 
collaborative and proactive approach 
to regulatory matters. In conclusion, I 
thank all our customers and business 
partners who all played a vital role in 
driving our growth in 2021 and look 
forward to sharing our journey with 
them.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S MESSAGE
As an organisation, SLT adopted a holistic and strategic approach aligned to our aspiration 
of driving connectivity through three pillars, namely being a catalyst in Sri Lanka’s digital 
journey, strengthening global connectivity and investing for the future. 
Our people strategy 
focused on the key 
pillars of empowering 
our team, enhancing 
productivity and offering 
opportunities for training 
and career development. 
We also directed 
significant investments in 
supporting the well-being 
of our people through 
comprehensive health 
and safety measures.
Dear Stakeholders,
The pandemic has forever 
transformed what we believed to be 
‘normal’, compelling communities, 
organisations and individuals to 
move out of their comfort zones 
and adapt to unique opportunities 
and challenges. In these conditions, 
SLT successfully leveraged its voice 
and data capabilities to support the 
interconnectivity of people, playing 
a vital role in ensuring continued 
economic activity, education, and 
entertainment in the country. This 
purpose helped SLT navigate the 
unprecedented challenges of the 
past year, informing our strategy and 
effectively directing our responses, 
which in turn has enabled a strong 
triple bottom line performance during 
the year. 
DELIVERING OUR ASPIRATIONS
As an organisation, SLT adopted 
a holistic and strategic approach 
aligned to our aspiration of driving 
connectivity through three pillars, 
namely being a catalyst in Sri Lanka’s 
digital journey, strengthening global 
connectivity and investing for the 
future. 
 Annual Report 2021 | 25
Catalyst in Sri Lanka’s digital journey
SLT is aptly positioned to spearhead 
aspirations towards a Smart Sri Lanka, 
through a multi-pronged approach 
centering on digital government, 
digital economy, digital infrastructure 
and digital inclusivity. In 2021, 
our interventions were focused 
towards addressing the broad-
based implications of the pandemic, 
particularly on facilitating remote 
working, education, distribution and 
supply chains and entertainment. 
Accordingly, SLT played a vital role in 
ensuring the continuity of economic 
activity through providing the 
necessary technology infrastructure 
and offerings to facilitate work-from-
home, both in the Government and 
private sector. Meanwhile, our wide-
ranging partnerships with Government 
institutions enabled the uninterrupted 
provision of essential government 
services across the country, which in 
turn allowed the general public to 
avail these services despite pandemic-
led disruptions. A key achievement 
during the year, was SLT’s ability to 
facilitate the unpredicted transition 
to digital learning through unique 
platforms, free access and attractive 
data packages. Despite the financial 
and operational constraints posed 
by COVID-19, the Group adopted a 
long-term view to value creation and 
continued to invest in the upgrade 
and expansion of our network 
including FTTH. These investments 
are expected to accrue significant 
benefits to Sri Lankan businesses, 
households and the Government over 
the medium-to-long term, providing 
access to  speedy, secure, reliable 
and affordable connectivity. We also 
supported continuity of agricultural 
and other distribution chains through 
unique platforms such as Cochchi.lk 
and the Helaviru platform.
Strengthening Global connectivity
Despite the challenges that prevailed 
during the year, SLT continued 
to invest in expanding its global 
footprint, including our optical fibre 
submarine cable systems. During the 
year we directed investments towards 
a new international cable system as a 
consortium partner, with aim of further 
expanding our points of the presence 
across the globe. 
Investing for the future
Our established track record as Sri 
Lanka’s national ICT solutions provider 
has armed us with deep insights 
on the evolution of technology, 
which enables us to future-proof 
our business through investments in 
infrastructure and technology. These 
investments are centered on providing 
best-in-class coverage, speed, 
security, reliability and performance 
to our domestic and international 
customers. In 2021, we continued 
to direct significant investments 
towards further expanding the FTTH 
network, in line with our aspirations of 
delivering fibre broadband technology 
to 2 million households by 2023. SLT 
Mobitel also further developed its 4G 
network and trialed 5G technologies 
during the year while investing in 
new data centres and multi-cloud 
platforms. Key investments planned 
for 2022 include the optical fibre 
network, 4G network expansions with 
5G capabilities along with Mobitel,  
international cables, multi-cloud 
platform expansions and carrier 
neutral data centres. 
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW 
The Company delivered a strong 
performance during the year, 
recording revenue growth of 16.0% 
to Rs.59.81 Bn and profit growth of 
45.9% to Rs. 5.87 Bn. Performance 
was upheld by the Company’s ability 
to swiftly cater to the unprecedented 
surge in demand for connectivity 
and speed, as reflected by the 
strong growth in broadband and 
data services. Despite a marginal 
decline in operating profitability, 
overall performance was upheld by 
strong dividend income from the 
Company’s subsidiaries. SLT also 
maintained financial resilience, with 
equity increasing by 5% led by good 
profitability and borrowings declining 
by 10%, resulting in the debt-to-
equity ratio improving from 0.77 to 
0.66 in 2021. 
OUR PEOPLE PROPOSITION
SLT continued to offer a unique value 
proposition to its +6,500 employees, 
who were a vital factor in facilitating 
connectivity and offering uninterrupted 
services to our customers. Our 
people strategy focused on the key 
pillars of empowering our team, 
enhancing productivity and offering 
opportunities for training and career 
development. We also directed 
significant investments in supporting 
the well-being of our people through 
comprehensive health and safety 
measures. The Company’s employee 
retention rate of around 95% during 
the year attests to the strength of its 
value proposition to employees, as 
we progress towards our aspiration of 
nurturing a dynamic and conducive 
environment for our team. 
WAY FORWARD
I firmly believe that improved 
secured and reliable connectivity is 
a vital tool in driving socio-economic 
empowerment and development. 
SLT has an important role to play in 
enabling this digital future and we are 
deeply committed to leveraging our 
capabilities, infrastructure and insights 
in propelling Sri Lanka towards the 
next phase of its digital growth. Our 
short-to-medium term aspiration is to 
fortify our market position across all 
domestic business verticals through 
further driving rural penetration and 
transforming the entire customer 
experience to improve service levels 
and retention. Key investments 
planned for 2022 include the optical 
fibre network, 4G network expansions 
with 5G capabilities along with 
Mobitel,  international cables, multi-
cloud platform expansions and carrier 
neutral data centres. The Company is 
also pursuing opportunities to unlock 
the value of its extensive landbank, 
through monetising these assets to 
fund expansion of our core business. 
We are cognisant of the inevitable 
short-to-medium term challenges 
arising from the country’s macro-
economic vulnerabilities and shortage 
in foreign currency which have made 
it difficult to import components, 
hardware and other infrastructure 
essential for expansion. Despite these 
risks, we are optimistic of the country’s 
revival over the medium-to-long 
term and as Sri Lanka’s national ICT 
solutions provider, will play a central 
role in propelling the country’s digital 
aspirations forward. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
As I look forward to an exciting year, I 
would like to extend my gratitude to 
the Chairman and Board of Directors for 
their guidance and valuable counsel. I 
also take this opportunity to thank each 
and every member of our team and our 
trade unions for their dedication and 
commitment in delivering the results 
set out in this Report despite extreme 
challenges. I also wish to thank all 
customers, business partners and other 
stakeholder who have partnered us in 
our journey and look forward to your 
continued support in the years to come. 
Thank you.

CHIEF OPERATING  
OFFICER’S REVIEW
Our people management strategy for the year centered on enhancing productivity and optimising 
human capital. With new recruitments limited for the year, focus was placed on empowering the 
team through providing access to technology tools, skill development and knowledge sharing. 
The Group’s success 
for the year was 
underpinned by its ability 
to swiftly embrace the 
new realities of the post-
pandemic world. As 
Sri Lanka experienced 
2nd and 3rd COVID-19 
waves, our foremost 
priority was ensuring 
the safety of our 
employees while rolling 
out our accelerated FTTH 
program. 
 Annual Report 2021 | 27
Dear Stakeholders,
Even though the pandemic of 
COVID 19 is a remaining tragedy 
for two consecutive years in Sri 
Lanka, as a Group, we managed to 
provide boundless and continuous 
services. SLT, the national ICT 
and Telecommunications service 
provider was called upon to lead 
the effort in transitioning to remote 
working, online education, virtual 
entertainment and keeping people 
connected. It was a responsibility we 
embraced with passion and integrity, 
and we are extremely proud of the 
unparalleled role we played during 
the year in facilitating Sri Lanka’s 
continued economic and social activity 
in these unprecedented times. 
The Group’s success for the year was 
underpinned by its ability to swiftly 
embrace the new realities of the 
post-pandemic world. As Sri Lanka 
experienced 2nd and 3rd COVID-19 
waves, our foremost priority was 
ensuring the safety of our employees 
while rolling out our accelerated FTTH 
program. The Group introduced an 
array of precautionary measures to 
minimise the risk of cross infection 
in line with the safety requirements 
recommended by local and global 
health authorities.  In addition to 
regular PCR testing and facilitating 
vaccinations, infected employees and 
their families were also given access to  
dedicated quarantine centres across 
the country. We also facilitated remote 
working in way of working from 
home, working from closest point to 
home and direct from home to field 
across the organisation, providing the 
relevant infrastructure and support for 
employees to deliver uninterrupted 
services.   
Our people management strategy 
for the year centered on enhancing 
productivity and optimising human 
capital. With new recruitments 
limited for the year, focus was placed 
on empowering the team through 
providing access to technology tools, 
skill development and knowledge 
sharing. We continued to invest in 
developing our talent and our training 
proposition for the year aimed to 
build a multi-skilled, future-proof 
talent pool. This approach enabled 
the Group to match employee 
competencies with the requirements 
of the job, thereby optimising our 
human capital. The commitment 
of our employees during these 
challenging times have been truly 
awe-inspiring, as they rallied behind 
our call to ensure uninterrupted 
services to customers across the 
country. 
Despite the uncertainty and turbulence 
that prevailed throughout the year, 
the Group adopted a long-term 
view to value creation, continuing to 
direct investments towards enhancing 
technology, connectivity and capacity. 
Key investments made during the 
year included expansion of the FTTH 
network, aligned with our aspirations 
of providing premium fibre broadband 
technology to 2 million households 
by 2023.  To date over 65,000km 
of fiber has been laid out, with a 
further 5000km expected in 2022. 
We enhanced our 4G network and 
started pre-commercial roll-out of our 
5G networks to offer fixed wireless 
and mobile broadband solutions. 
The Group also invested in new data 
centres and multi- cloud platforms 
during the year. Increased migration to 
cloud-based platforms and multimedia 
consumption led to unprecedented 
demand for bandwidth, which in turn 
required continued investments in 
expanding the core, broadband and IP 
networks. Given the increased demand 
on the international network, we also 
expanded our global footprint, which is 
facilitated through our submarine and 
undersea fibre optic cable systems. 
Through these investments, we 
hope to offer holistic services across 
all industry verticals and customer 
segments, including B2B, B2C  
and B2G. 
Disruptions to our supply chain 
remained a key challenge during the 
year, reflecting global shortages in 
components and the country’s foreign 
currency shortage. In addressing this 
challenge, the Group proactively 
sought to re-engineer processes 
while recovering and reconditioning 
selected input materials. We also 
ensured the effective management 
of inventories through lead-time 
controls and demand planning, 
which in turn enabled the Group to 
minimise stock-out situations. We 
have also driven efforts in expanding 
our local procurement, thereby 
providing local manufacturers the 
opportunity to expand capabilities 
and competencies. 
The unprecedented shift to digital 
platforms has led to a parallel increase 
in cybersecurity vulnerabilities, with 
data confidentiality, data manipulation 
and attacks by malicious actors 
emerging as key threats in the 
risk landscape. We have placed 
strategic focus on strengthening 
our cybersecurity defenses, through 
enhancing end-point detection and 
response systems and improving 
monitoring across all platforms. 
Vulnerability assessments, penetration 
testing and implementation of an 
internal security centre have also 
strengthened our defenses. As a result 
of these efforts, the Group was able 
to effectively manage its cybersecurity 
risks during the year, with no major 
incidents reported.
Following the strengthening of 
the Group’s quality management 
framework last year, we have 
continued to make inroads in 
improving our processes, enhancing 
workmanship, ensuring conformity to 
standards and promoting risk-based 
thinking. In 2021,we transitioned to 
a 100% testing system through an 
app-based platform, enabling quick 
reporting and immediate follow-up of 
any quality related issues.
Consistently enhancing the service 
and experience offered to customers 
is a core pillar of our strategy. In recent 
years, we have encouraged customers 
to adopt digital channels to interact 
with us, enhancing the features and 
user experience of the MySLT App. We 
also continued to invest in developing 
the product knowledge and customer-
service skills of our front-line staff while 
the contact centre employees have 
access to a dedicated training unit 
ensuring that they remain updated on 
the dynamic and evolving requirements 
of customers. 
Pandemic-led disruptions have 
changed the world as we know it, 
dramatically altering the way we 
work, learn, entertain and connect 
with others. As Sri Lanka’s national 
ICT and telecommunications service 
provider, we remain steadfast 
in our commitment to facilitate 
this transition by empowering 
individuals, businesses and the 
government through connectivity and 
digitalisation.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
The global telecommunications 
industry is the bedrock on which 
modern socioeconomic activity 
is built and it is hard to imagine a 
sphere of activity untouched by 
telecommunications. The pandemic 
made its relevance universal as it 
underpinned the way we interacted 
with the rest of the world. Working 
from home, online learning and 
entertainment were seamlessly 
integrated while applications to 
engage and empower customers 
proliferated accelerating digitalisation 
of nearly every aspect of life. 
Technology companies experienced 
unprecedented demand for their 
services and this amplified the 
demand for broadband services. The 
trend continued in 2021 as waves 
and variants of COVID-19 continued 
to disrupt economic activity. Working 
from home, online learning and 
entertainment were seamlessly 
integrated as the world embraced 
the possibilities of the 5th industrial 
revolution. Business experienced 
cost efficiencies as digital platforms 
provided the scalability and cost 
rationalisation that were a key area 
of focus. Consumer dependency on 
e-commerce surged as did financial 
transactions. 
For Telcos, the investments continue 
to be an area of key concern as 
the rapid evolution in technology 
necessitates replacement of old 
technologies prior to economic 
utilisation of their useful life. However, 
it has also meant that markets 
were getting saturated and intense 
competition was eroding margins. 
The services offered by Telcos were 
becoming more commoditized and 
future forward Telcos needed to 
transform into technology companies, 
expanding their portfolio of value 
added services to compete effectively 
with established technology 
companies. Telcos are well poised 
for the transformation as the 
analytics available provide a distinct 
competitive advantage. Unlocking 
this value will be key to increasing 
the share of wallet of the customer 
and extending their life cycle by 
adding relevant products to manage 
customer value.
COUNTRY PROFILE
Sri Lanka’s economy is estimated to 
have grown by 4%1after weathering 
a lockdown in the 3rd quarter due to 
the Delta variant. The country made 
significant progress in vaccinating its 
population with 96% of its population 
vaccinated with at least one dose, 
82% with the 2nd dose and 54% 
with the booster by 26th March 
2022.2 Interest rates which were low 
in the first half of the year moved 
upwards in the latter half as monetary 
policy was tightened in response to 
economic developments. Inflation 
increased during the year to 12.1% 
which was driven by a number of 
factors including increased supply 
chain costs and commodity prices. 
Additionally, the sharp decrease in 
inflows of foreign exchange for a 
prolonged period and government 
debt repayments resulted in a 
foreign exchange liquidity crisis 
and a devaluation of the Sri Lankan 
rupee leading to wide ranging import 
restrictions and an energy crisis by 
early 2022.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
SECTOR IN SRI LANKA
The Telecommunications sector in the 
country is one of the most dynamic 
sectors and its growth was accelerated 
with the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic in 2020. Social distancing 
became a necessity since then to 
minimise risk, and wide ranging 
business disruptions made working 
from home and learning from home 
a necessity, increasing the demand 
for reliable telecommunication 
services to stay connected to family, 
workplaces, learning institutions, 
other economic activity and social 
interactions. An essential service 
that supports Sri Lanka’s connectivity 
to global opportunities, the 
telecommunications sector grew 
by 10.9% in 2020 and accounted 
for 0.66% of GDP in the same year.

has been supported by accelerated 
digitalisation of business applications 
to facilitate customer engagement 
and enable employees to work 
remotely during the past two years. 
This trend is expected to continue as 
we move into the industrial revolution 
that is being shaped by the rapid 
adoption of artificial intelligence 
supported by access to big data 
and improved hardware processing 
capabilities.
Telecommunications is pivotal 
to the country’s digital future 
as it provides the necessary 
infrastructure to drive growth. Sri 
Lanka’s telecommunications sector is 
regulated by the Telecommunications 
Regulatory Commission (TRC). 
Additionally, the Information and 
Communications Technology 
Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) is a 
key government agency shaping 
the development of the national 
telecommunications and technology 
landscape with a mandate to making 
Sri Lanka a digitally inclusive country 
with a mission of transforming Sri 
Lanka as a creative knowledge-based 
society.
There are 28 licenses issued by 
the TRC as above and the Sri 
Lanka Telecom Group holds 4 of 
these licenses as set out in the 
table alongside. Growth of the 
country’s telecommunication sector 
is graphically depicted overleaf. 
The charts set out reflect the 
coverage and increasing demand for 
telecommunication services in the 
country.

DETERMINING MATERIAL ISSUES
72 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management is 
fundamental to the Group’s 
ability to create sustainable 
value for stakeholders 
in the short, medium 
and long term and the 
Group has set in place a 
robust risk management 
structure and processes for 
management of enterprise 
risks. These processes also 
facilitate identification of 
opportunities for growth 
which is an integral part 
of the risk management 
process.
RISK GOVERNANCE
The Board bears ultimate 
responsibility for managing risk and 
allocating resources to mitigation 
of the same. The SLT Group has in 
place a well-established system of 
risk management which enables the 
Group to identify, measure, monitor 
and manage risks effectively. The 
year under review saw significant 
threats emerge which have been 
managed with increased alert levels 
throughout the Group, facilitating 
early identification and mitigation of 
potential risks.

AN UNCERTAIN RISK 
LANDSCAPE
The prolonged duration of the 
pandemic posed significant threats 
exposing and amplifying the 
economic vulnerability of people, 
businesses and countries. Business 
disruption continued in 2021 with 
new variants and waves, heightening 
concerns for health and safety and 
business continuity. Vaccinations 
were rolled out albeit unevenly 
across countries and by early 2022, 
a number of countries were well into 
the booster dose. Predictions that the 
pandemic was nearing endemicity 
saw a return to physical work as 
employers were eager for employees 
to return to work as supply chain 
and logistics issues continued to 
hinder economic activity and growth. 
Inflation rose as commodity prices 
increased in the first half of 2021 and 
supply demand stresses continued. 
Quantitative easing measures 
adopted by many governments with 
the onset of the pandemic gave 
way to tightening monetary policy 
resulting in upward movement of 
interest rates in the latter half of 
2021. Migration to digital platforms 
by individuals and entities continued 
during the year and businesses 
accelerated their digitalisation plans, 
enhancing capacity utilisation of 
digital infrastructure around the 
world. Cybersecurity threats increased 
exponentially with hackers becoming 
more sophisticated giving rise to 
increased investments cybersecurity. 
By the 4th quarter of 2021 there 
was a convergence of risk factors in 
Sri Lanka, increasing its economic 
vulnerability and resulting in further 
downgrades to its sovereign rating. 
Continuing woes in the Tourism 
sector and lower inward remittance 
coupled with large government debt 
repayments resulted in a foreign 
exchange liquidity crisis which has 
also led to an energy crisis and a 
sharp devaluation of the Sri Lankan 
rupee by end March 2022. The 
seeming convergence of risk factors 
has exacerbated the uncertainties 
for the year ahead with significant 
uncertainties in the socioeconomic 
landscape.

RISK SUMMARY
Risks Mitigation & Opportunities Assessment
FINANCIAL RISKS
Financial resilience is key to growth and sustainability of the business and sustained earnings
 Increasing interest rates
 Potential deterioration in affordability of 
services and credit quality due to inflationary 
pressures and reduced disposable income
 Elevated levels of exchange rate risk with 
sharp devaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee in 
March 2022 making investments expensive
 Foreign exchange liquidity crisis with wide 
ranging import restrictions
 Exchange rate risk makes investments in 
infrastructure more expansive
 Commodity price risk and inflation is 
expected to increase operational costs
 Risk rating affirmed at AA- (lka) with a stable 
outlook by Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd., supports 
Group’s ability to source capital
 Prudent debt equity ratio of 66.1% provides 
sufficient headroom for increasing debt in 
case of need
 Prudent debt management and strong 
cashflow generation mitigates potential 
impact of rising interest rates
 Strong credit control supports liquidity
 Enhancing digital payment channels for retail 
customers
 Introducing several Financing options to 
reduce forex exposure
 Potential opportunities for growth in payment 
channel offerings to customers
 Headroom to increase tariffs as it is amongst 
the lowest in the world although this needs to 
be balanced with inflationary pressures 
 SLT Group dollar deposits provide a hedge 
against exchange rate fluctuations
High
Despite increasing 
threat levels, the 
Group is financially 
resilient as evinced by 
its strong credit rating 
affirmed in January 
2022. However, the 
impact on profitability 
can be high due to 
the escalation in 
operational costs. 
Therefore, the risk is 
assessed as High.
PEOPLE RISKS
Risks related to workforce, consumers, and community
 Spread of pandemic within workforce and 
community
 Health and safety of employees and 
consumers
 Retaining skilled talent pools during 
economic crisis
 Upskilling employees to adapt to changes in 
technology and digital transformation
 Supporting employees migrate to new norms 
of working
 Implemented stringent health and safety 
protocols to mitigate pandemic risks 
including remote working, minimising 
physical gatherings, provision of PPE, holistic 
care package for employees
 Increasing investment in training and 
development aligning with digital 
transformation 
 Intrapreneurship opportunities for employees 
through The Embryo initiative
Mitigating actions 
implemented for 
People risks have 
been effective, 
supporting growth 
in employee and 
customer satisfaction. 
Despite this, the risk 
is assessed as High 
due to the strategic 
importance of the risk 
category.
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
 Annual Report 2021 | 75
Risks Mitigation & Opportunities Assessment
TECHNOLOGY RISK
The rapid evolution of technology in the telecommunications and allied fields, the surge in demand with the onset of the 
pandemic and opportunities for institutional transformation makes this category of risk critical to sustained earning growth. 
 Consumer demand for increasingly high 
bandwidth and speeds for evolving lifestyles
 Surge in subscriber base and digital 
transaction volumes which may or may not be 
sustained in a post pandemic era
 Affordability of new technologies in emerging 
and developing markets
 Speed of technology evolution in increasing, 
making current technologies obsolete
 Dedicated network planning function to 
assess short-, medium-, and long-term needs 
of the SLT Group
 Accelerated investments to meet the surge in 
demand
 Expansion and roll out of fibre and 5G 
networks
 Investment in the 6th SEA-ME-WE cable, 
upgrading of the 4th and retirement of the 
3rd cables.
 Collaboration with ICTA, TRCSL and other 
influential technology associations to assess 
future requirements and planning investments
As adoption of 
cutting-edge 
technology is critical 
to the Group’s 
strategic goals, the 
risks are assessed as 
High.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
As telecommunications is an essential service, maintaining continuous service in a safe and secure manner presents 
significant challenges which are classified as operational risks.
 Business continuity amidst the pandemic 
and related lockdowns presented several 
challenges
 Servicing customer requests and visiting 
homes presented challenges for field staff
 Cyberthreats escalated during the year 
 Ensuring sufficient energy for network 
operations during energy crisis
 Compliance with evolving regulatory 
requirements
 Detailed business continuity plans prepared 
to manage the risks during pandemic
 Strict health and safety protocols 
implemented to minimise threat of contagion
 Ramped up investments in cyber security 
to identify and monitor potential threats to 
institution and customers
 Increased rigour of oversight and review by 
internal audit
 Processes are in place to facilitate regulatory 
compliance which is also a matter of internal 
audit review
Assessed as Medium 
due to efficacy of 
mitigation activities
76 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
Risks Mitigation & Opportunities Assessment
STRATEGIC RISKS
These risks have a significant impact in determining the effectiveness of strategy and achievement of goals.
 Consumer behaviour patterns underwent a 
significant change during the pandemic and 
remain in a state of flux
 The business model of the Group is 
evolving and a planned transformation 
from a telecommunications company to a 
technology company is taking shape and 
form
 As resources are finite, it is critical to prioritise 
strategies and allocate sufficient resources to 
achieve successful outcomes
 As the National Telecommunications 
service provider, our reputation is critical to 
maintaining reliable and credible relationships 
with our stakeholders
 Data analytics undertaken to monitor 
consumer behaviour
 Focus on Research and Development through 
the Embryo project
 Regular stakeholder surveys
 Prudent management of resources 
 Well established procurement and tender 
procedures with oversight by the Board
 Brand surveys
 Ratings
 Clear communication of transformational 
goals and management of the process
Threat is assessed 
as Medium due 
to effectiveness of 
mitigating activities
ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
Environmental risks are increasingly becoming apparent with depletion of non-renewable sources and resultant demand 
supply gaps
 Energy management is key to managing 
emissions and impact on climate change
 Rising costs of energy 
 Rising costs of non-renewable resources due 
to supply limitations

INCOME STATEMENT
Revenue 
Group revenue increased by 12.3% 
to Rs.102.3 Bn in 2021 as online 
activity surged with continuing 
lockdowns and acceleration of 
digital infrastructure development 
by businesses. Consumer migration 
to digital platforms for transactions, 
learning and entertainment continued 
to gather momentum in 2021 as 
well. Intermittent lockdowns also 
necessitated working and learning 
online which supported increased 
usage of broadband. PEO TV 
also recorded healthy growth 
underpinned by surge in usage and 
new connections. Usage increased 
across all customer segments ranging 
from individuals to corporate and 
government entities. Demand for 
fixed voice services was stable in 2021 
supported by increased connections 
in contrast to the declining trend 
observed in 2020.
Increased coverage through the 
Group’s accelerated fibre expansion 
programme and the expansion of 
the 4G LTE network were major 
contributory factors for new 
connections. It is noteworthy that 
the revenue increase was achieved 
despite offering attractive pricing on 
learning and working tariff packages 
taking into consideration the need to 
ensure affordability and also that there 
were no tariff increases during the 
reporting year.
Revenue from Carrier Domestic 
business grew significantly during 
the year while the revenue from data 
products provided to Corporate and 
Government business segments too 
grew notably year-on-year. 
Revenue from Fixed Telephony 
increased by 16% to Rs.59.8 Bn in 
2021 accounting for 53.4% of Group 
Revenue. Mobile revenue increased 
by 8.7% to Rs.47.1 Bn accounting  
for 44.5% of Group Revenue.
EBITDA
Group EBITDA increased by 16.1% 
to Rs. 41.2 Bn reinforced by revenue 
growth and improved operational 
efficiencies. The brand unification 
played a key role in driving synergies 
which enabled us to curtail marketing 
cost increase to 9.3%. Additionally, 
programmes such as waste to cash 
also drove savings as we recycled 
and repurposed used materials, 
integrating sustainable practices into 
our processes. These resulted in an 
improved EBITDA margin of 40.2% 
in 2021 compared to 38.9% in 2020 
which was commendable as it was 
achieved without upward revisions in 
tariff structures.
Fixed operations of the Group 
recorded an EBITDA of Rs. 21.4 Bn, 
up by 16.4%. The EBITDA margin 
grew from 35.7% in the year before to 
35.9%. EBITDA of Mobile operations 
grew to Rs. 19.5 Bn, reflecting a 
17.7% growth, pushing the EBITDA 
margin up to 41.3% from 38.2% in the 
year 2020.

MANAGING COSTS
Cost rationalisation was a key area 
in 2021 as the Group needed to 
increase spending in Sales and 
Marketing to grow market share while 
depreciation was exerting pressure 
on costs as we continued to upgrade 
and expand our network. During the 
year, Administrative costs increased 
by 10.7% primarily stemming from the 
increased Depreciation & Amortisation 
costs by 14.7%  and increased 
International Settlement cost by Rs. 
1.4 Bn resulting from the increase of 
Transit revenue during the year. The 
overall cost increase of 11.3%, which 
was sufficiently below the revenue 
growth rate of 12.3%, together lifted 
the Operating Profit up by 19% and 
improved the Operating Profit margin 
to 13.5%.
PROFIT BEFORE & AFTER TAX
Profit before tax (PBT) increased by 
32% to Rs.12.8 Bn supported by 
increased revenue, improved cost 
management, increase in other income 
and reduced foreign exchange losses. 
Taxation also decreased during the 
year by 64.1% due to reduced tax rates 
which also provided a strong boost to 
profitability. Accordingly, profit after tax 
increased by 54.3% to Rs.12.2 Bn. 
Sri Lanka Telecom 
strengthened its financial 
position through strategic 
investments to enhance 
revenue generation 
capability and prudent 
capital management to 
strengthen its financial 
resilience. The infographic 
below reflects the changes 
from 2020 to 2021.
FINANCIAL CAPITAL
Profit after tax of Mobile operations 
recorded its highest profits in its

managed to maintain the Trade

OUR MANAGEMENT 
APPROACH
Our Human Resource (HR) policies 
and procedures are compliant with the 
relevant Sri Lankan labour laws and 
regulatory standards and aligned to 
industry best practices. Robust policy 
frameworks are in place to ensure that 
an equitable and thriving environment 
is created for all our employees. We 
continuously review the HR reporting 
and governance structure that is in 
place and make necessary changes to 
ensure it is relevant and up to date.
The changes made during the year are 
mentioned below. 
 Rearrangement of the regional 
group structure to empower 
regional management to initiate 
internal staff deployments within 
regions. This will enhance the 
employee work-life balance, 
facilitate ease of working and 
enable the delivery of a strong 
customer service.
 Cadre Review and new 
organizational design in line 
with span of control and line of 
authority benchmarked across SLT 
PLC.
MOVEMENTS IN OUR TEAM
We have in place a structured 
talent sourcing and management 
strategy which set out the process 
for attracting, developing and 
retaining our employees. It is a holistic 
approach, which creates the right 
values and environment for staff to 
feel empowered and is a key factor for 
our success. 
Our recruitment procedure is robust, 
involving an interview and several 
assessment processes to ensure 
the right individuals are directly 
absorbed into the organization on a 
permanent basis. As a leading digital 
services provider in Sri Lanka, in 
the next few years we are planning 
to incorporate virtual reality into 
the recruitment process to test 
certain skills of the candidates, 
which will give them an outstanding 
experience while also creating brand 
recognition for the organization. 
Despite the many challenges created 
by the pandemic, there was no 
downsizing of staff during the year. 
In 2021, we recruited a total of 185 
employees at SLT, including the 
children of our employees as well as 
the immediate family members of 
demised employees. Our retention 
rate is over 98.75%, which is a strong 
testament to the strength of our 
value proposition to employees. 285 
employees retired during the year 
while only 67 employees resigned.  At 
Mobitel, we recruited a total of 174 
employees during the year and we 
have a retention rate of 94.15%.

DIGITALIZATION OF HR 
OPERATIONS
In order to implement a digital 
workplace strategy, various HR 
Processes including recruitment, talent 
development and promotion were 
automated during the year, leading 
to reduction in the time spent on 
repetitive tasks as well as creating 
a green atmosphere within the HR 
Group. The planned implementation 
of Document Management System 
(DMS) via the ERP system will lead 
to a reduction of paper usage by 
70%-80% within the HR Group. 
Digital transformation is affecting 
the human resource management 
function at a rapid speed, allowing 
HR to become more data driven by 
presenting evidence-based insights to 
make accurate decisions. The biggest 
challenge for the HR Group in this 
data driven culture will be finding the 
right balance between technology 
and the human role.
The latest advancements in machine 
learning and artificial intelligence 
are rapidly developing in the global 
scenario. We hope to integrate these 
developments into our HR processes 
in the next few years for the benefit of 
the organization as a whole.
EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND 
SAFETY
GRI: A1.1 / A1.2 / A1.3 / A1.4 / A1.5 / A1.6
As a responsible employer, ensuring 
the health and wellbeing of our 
people became a priority during the 
year. We fully adhere to the health 
and other statutory requirements and 
have implemented organization wide 
HR policies through the establishment 
of a COVID-19 management steering 
committee.  
Having continued operations during 
the pandemic, we understood the 
impact of the pandemic on work, the 
workforce and workplace. HR became 
the centerpiece of guiding and 
managing the other functions in the 
adoption of organization wide safety

REMUNERATION, 
RECOGNITION AND REWARDS
As part of our people experience, we 
provide an attractive and competitive 
remuneration for all our employees. In 
addition to the remuneration, we offer 
a range of other benefits and rewards 
including loans at concessionary 
rates, medical allowances and death 
donations. These are designed to 
retain employees and motivate them 
to perform better in order to help 
the organization achieve its overall 
strategic goals. During the year, 
longstanding salary anomalies were 
addressed through an equitable 
solution. The table above shows the 
benefits provided to employees and 
their families who were affected by 
COVID 19.
Performance Management 
We have a performance-based 
culture where 100% of our employees 
undergo performance appraisals 
evaluated on predetermined key 
performance indicators during the 
year. Employees are recognized and 
rewarded through performance-based 
bonuses linked to the Performance 
Management System. During the year, 
individual performance management 
with peer evaluation system was also 
introduced to the final evaluation 
process. We have also aligned the 
rewarding mechanism with the 
organizational innovation framework. 
Career Progression
We nurture a strong learning 
environment through succession 
planning and leadership development 
initiatives which helps our employees 
reach their full potential. Having 
understood the role of leaders in 
driving the growth of the people, 
last year, we completed a plan to 
ensure a strong leadership pipeline 
is maintained for the top level. Based 
on this plan, succession planning was 
implemented this year as well.
Opportunities for promotions are 
available to employees if they meet 
the defined criteria in the SLT Staff 
Recruitment and Promotion Scheme 
(SRPS) based on their professional 
qualifications, performance, and 
experience. Candidates are selected 
for promotions through written 
examinations and/or interviews. 
During the year initiatives were taken 
to redesign the SRPS based on current 
industry standards. This will strengthen 
employee skills and create a skill-
based path for career advancement.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
Enhancing the knowledge and 
capabilities of our workforce is a 
key value proposition offered by the 
Group. We assess the knowledge gap 
of employees and fulfill the training 
requirements accordingly. Training 
and development opportunities are 
offered through formal and on the 
job training with regular feedback 
provided via the appraisal system. 
During the year, with the digitalization 
of operations and increased remote 
working arrangements, there was a 
need to provide training to improve 
IT capabilities, network connectivity 
and cyber security knowledge of the 
employees as well.
SLT Talent Development Division 
The SLT Talent Development Division 
which constitutes our training delivery 
arm has three fully fledged Talent 
Development Centers (TDC) which 
are ISO 9001:2015 certified. Although 
these centres were initiated for the 
development of the human capital 
of the company, we have expanded 
our capacity through affiliations with 
reputed bodies, to generate revenue 
for SLT. TDC has proven its strength 
in the higher education sector of 
the country by opening doors to the 
public to pursue technician certificates 
and Higher National Diplomas. In 
collaboration with the University 
of Hertfordshire – UK, TDC offers 
a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) 
Degree program as well. Even with 
the numerous challenges created by 
the COVID-19 pandemic, SLTDC has 
been able to generate Rs. 88 Mn as 
revenue for SLT in 2021.

Relationships with trade unions
87.3% of the organization’s employees are represented through 24 trade 
unions and covered by collective bargaining process. We maintained cordial 
relationships with the trade unions and there were no instances of disruption to 
work on industrial disputes during the period under review. Having understood 
the importance of this stakeholder group, we have adopted an open-door policy 
and an inclusive approach with them and have built a strong mutually beneficial 
relationship over the years, which has helped us to improve working conditions, 
enable better decision making through collective bargaining as well as promoting 
equality and harmony within the Group. There is a dedicated section in the HR 
Group to attend to the trade union concerns as quickly as possible.
We support the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining by:
Diverse workplace and Gender Parity
We pride ourselves in being an equal 
opportunity employer nurturing a 
diverse and inclusive culture within 
the organization. We have employees 
with varying skills, perspectives and 
social and religious backgrounds 
who blend together to provide an 
excellent level of service. Our policies 
and procedures promote equality 
of opportunity regardless of gender, 
age, race or religion and we do not 
discriminate employees based on any 
grounds. There were no incidents of 
discrimination reported during the year.
Gender diversity is a key area of focus 
through all levels of the Company, 
and we are committed to creating 
an enabling environment for women 
working within the company. We 
have 26% females within our team 
despite being in the tech industry 
where traditionally women are under 
represented. During the year, all 
pregnant women were allowed to 
work from home to ensure their safety. 
We provide maternity leave as per the 
stipulated regulations.
 Considering the fact that 
many global corporations 
have announced plans to 
embrace some form of 
remote working beyond 
the pandemic, we are 
also looking to make 
these modes of work a 
permanent fixture in the 
Company’s range of work 
options.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF  
SRI LANKA TELECOM PLC
Report on the audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Sri Lanka

which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 
31 December 2021, and the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement 
of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the 
Financial Statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying Financial Statements of 
the Company and the Group give a true and fair view of the 
financial position of the Company and the Group as at  
31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and 
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Accounting Standards.
Basis for opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka 
Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the Group in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka 
(Code of Ethics) and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters  
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
Financial Statements of the current period. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
For each matter below, our description of how our audit 
addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our report, including in relation 
to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the 
performance of procedures designed to respond to our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
Financial Statements. The results of our audit procedures, 
including the procedures performed to address the matters 
below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the 
accompanying Financial Statements.

120 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition of fixed telephony and mobile 
communication services
The Group recognized revenue of LKR 100,269 Mn from the 
provision of fixed telephony & mobile communication services 
for the year ended 31 December 2021 in accordance with its 
accounting policy set out in Note 3 (k) to the financial statements
Recognition of revenue from the provision of fixed telephony & 
mobile communication services was a key focus of our audit due 
to:
—  Provision of telecommunication services to customers involve 
frequent changes in rate structures and arrangements with 
multiple features. It comprises a large volume of transactions 
which arise from sales of different combinations of hardware 
and services that are captured, processed and recorded by 
the Group using multiple IT systems.
—  Significant judgement exercised by management when 
determining: 
a. Whether to recognize revenue at a point in time or over 
a period for revenue arrangements  
b.  Duration of customer contracts  
c. Transaction price and allocating it to bundled products 
and services
Our audit procedures included the following amongst others;
> We involved our internal specialized resources to assist us with;
>  Evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of IT 
General Controls and IT Application Controls of IT systems 
having significant impact over revenue recognition.
> Evaluating the adequacy of controls implemented for security 
monitoring aspects over selected IT systems related to revenue 
recognition.
> We evaluated the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of IT dependent manual controls and manual controls 
including performing re-computations and testing end-to-end 
reconciliations, as relevant.
> We assessed the reasonableness of significant judgements 
made by management when determining the timing of revenue 
recognition, duration of customer contracts and when allocating 
transaction price to bundled products and services of major 
revenue streams, based on the respective terms and conditions of 
customer contracts.
> We also assessed the adequacy of related disclosures reflected in 
Note 3 (k) and Note 6 (a) of the Financial Statements.
Estimated Useful Lives and Capital Work-in-Progress of Network 
Assets
As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s network assets accounted 
for 43% of the consolidated total assets and Group’s capital work-
in-progress related to such network assets accounted for 9% of 
the consolidated total assets. 
Depreciation on network assets amounted to LKR 16,685 Mn 
for the year ended 31 December 2021. The Group’s policy is to 
calculate the depreciation of an asset over its estimated useful life 
on a straight-line basis.
Estimating the useful lives of network assets requires judgment by 
the management and is a key focus for our audit. It involves the 
Group’s collective assessment of the industry practice, internal 
technical evaluation and experience with the similar assets in 
concluding the useful lives of network assets.
Capital work in progress of network assets was a key focus for our 
audit due to the:
—  Degree of judgement involved, and assumptions used when 
assessing impairment of amounts of capital work – in – 
progress relevant to projects of an extended duration
and
—  Importance of timeliness in transferring amounts from capital 
work – in – progress of network assets to the relevant class of 
property, plant and equipment, when such items have been 
commissioned for use.
The Group’s disclosures on property and equipment are included 
in Notes 3 (d) and 14 to the consolidated Financial Statements 
and the disclosures on capital work-in-progress are included in 
Notes 3 (d) (iv) and 14 to the consolidated Financial Statements.
Our audit procedures included the following amongst others;
> We obtained an understanding of the Group’s process in estimating 
the useful lives of network assets. 
> We inquired with the Group’s network engineers on their evaluation 
of the relevance of current technology and its utilization for future 
periods. 
> We tested management assessment of the estimated useful lives 
of network assets against industry data and practice and other 
relevant external data. 
> We evaluated whether management has identified possible 
indicators of impairment for any project related to network 
assets which have not been commissioned for a prolonged 
period including evaluating the reasonableness of management 
judgements applied and assumptions used based on our 
knowledge of the business and industry.
> By discussion with the respective project managers and inspection 
of relevant documentation, we 
>  checked the current status of completion of those projects in 
relation to budgeted project duration 
and
>  whether amounts related to network assets commissioned for 
use have been appropriately transferred out of capital work–in-
progress and recognized under the relevant class of property, 
plant & equipment, on a timely basis
> We also assessed the adequacy of related disclosures made in the 
Financial Statements.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
 Annual Report 2021 | 121
Other Information included in the 2021 Annual Report
Other information consists of the information included in the 
Annual Report, other than the Financial Statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. Management is responsible for the 
other information.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover 
the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the management and those charged with 
governance
Management is responsible for the preparation of Financial 
Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, and for such internal control 
as management determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, management is 
responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate 
the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s and the Group’s financial 
reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SLAuSs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial 
Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
> Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
> Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
internal controls of the Company and the Group.
> Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management.
> Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the Financial 
Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
> Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Financial Statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
> Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the 
consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance of the group 
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with ethical requirements in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
As required by section 163 (2) of the Companies Act No. 
07 of 2007, we have obtained all the information and 
explanations that were required for the audit and as far as 
appears from our examination, proper accounting records 
have been kept by the Company.

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

and have been applied consistently by the Group 
entities,except amendments to existing accounting standards 
which are efffective from 1 January 2021 as described in 
Note 3 (w)
(a) Basis of consolidation
(i) Business combinations
The Group accounts for business combinations using the 
acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. 
The consideration transferred in acquisition is generally 
measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets 
acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for 
impairment. Any gain or bargain purchase is recognised in 
profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed 
as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity 
securities.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts 
related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such 
amounts are generally recognised in Statement of Profit or 
Loss.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at 
the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent 
consideration that meets the definition of a financial 
instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured 
and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognized for non-controlling interests and any previous 
interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed). If the fair value of the net assets acquired 
is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the 
Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of 
the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and 
reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be 
recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still 
results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired 
over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the 
recognized in Statement of Profit or Loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to 
benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other 
assets or liabilities of the acquire are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit 
(CGU) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation 
is included in the carrying amount of the operation when 
determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed 
in these circumstances is measured based on the relative 
values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-
generating unit retained.
(ii) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. 
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the 
Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Group loses control over the subsidiary.
As per the reporting date the group has changed the 
accounting treatment of its investments in SLT Campus 
(Private) Limited from a subsidiary to non current assets held 
for sale as per the ‘SLFRS 5 - Non current assets held for sale 
and discontionued operations’ as disclosed in note 16.1 and 
22.
(ii- a)  Critical judgements in applying the entity’s 
accounting policies
The directors have concluded that the Group controls all 
subsidiaries as it has majority control and voting rights over 
its subsidiaries as depicted in Note (ii-b).
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 131
(iii) Equity - accounted investees (Investment in associates 
and joint ventures)
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in 
the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee 
but is not control or joint control over those policies.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the 
parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights 
to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, 
which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities 
require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining significant influence 
or joint control is similar to those necessary to determine 
control over subsidiaries. The Group’s investments in its 
associates and joint venture are accounted for using the 
equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate 
or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying 
amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in 
the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture 
since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate 
or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment and is not tested for impairment separately.
The Statement of Profit or Loss reflects the Group’s share of 
the results of operations of the associate or joint venture. Any 
change in Other Comprehensive Income of those investees 
is presented as part of the Group’s Other Comprehensive 
Income. In addition, when there has been a change 
recognised directly in the equity of the associate or joint 
venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when 
applicable, in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Unrealised 
gains and losses resulting from transactions between the 
Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to 
the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of 
an associate and a joint venture is shown on the face of 
the Statement of Profit or Loss outside operating profit 
and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling 
interests in the subsidiaries of the associate or joint venture.
The Financial Statements of the associate or joint venture are 
prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting 
policies in line with those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group 
determines whether it is necessary to recognise an 
impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint 
venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that the investment in 
the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such 
evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment 
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 
associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then 
recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit or loss of equity 
accounted investees’ in the Statement of Profit or Loss.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint 
control over the joint venture, the Group measures and 
recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any 
difference between the carrying amount of the associate or 
joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control 
and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds 
from disposal is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
(iv)  Non conrtolling interest ( NCI)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.Changes in 
the group interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss 
of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
(v) Loss of control
When the group loses control over a subsidiary, it 
derecognises the asset and liabilities of the subsidiary and 
any related NCI (if applicable) and other components of 
equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss. Any interest in the former subsidiary is measured at fair 
value when control is lost.
(vi) Transaction eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealised 
income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, 
are eliminated.
(b) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the 
respective functional currencies of Group companies at the 
exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at 
the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that 
are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the 
fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences 
are generally recognised in statement of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are 
measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not translated.
(c)  Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
(i)  Financial assets
(i-i)  Initial recognition and mearsurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through 
profit or loss.
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition 
depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow 
characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing 
them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not 
contain a significant financing component or for which the 
Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially 
measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case 
of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a 
significant financing component or for which the Group 
has applied the practical expedient are measured at the 
transaction price as disclosed in Note 3(k) - Revenue from 
contracts with customers.
In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured 
at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give 
rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and 
interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding. This 
assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed 
at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that 
are not SPPI are classified and measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.
The Group’s business model for managing financial assets 
refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to 
generate cash flows. The business model determines 
whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash 
flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets 
are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition 
unless the Group changes its business model for managing 
financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets 
are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period 
following the change in the business model.Purchases or 
sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within 
a time frame established by regulation or convention in the 
market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade 
date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or 
sell the asset.
(i-ii)  Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets 
are classified in four categories;
> Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
> Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)
> Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI 
with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon 
derecognition (equity instruments)
> Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both 
following conditions are met:
> The financial asset is held within a business model with 
the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows, and
> The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 133
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured 
using the effective interest rate (EIR) method and are subject 
to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or 
loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.
The Group’s financial assets at amortised cost include trade 
and other receivables, amounts due from related parties and 
cash and cash equivalents.
Financial assets at fair value through OCI (debt instruments)
The Group measures debt instruments at fair value through 
OCI if both of following conditions are met:
> The financial asset is held within a business model with 
the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash 
flows and selling, and
> The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, interest 
income, foreign exchange revaluation and impairment 
losses or reversals are recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss and computed in the same manner as for financial 
assets measured at amortised cost. The remaining fair value 
changes are recognised in OCI. Upon derecognition, the 
cumulative fair value change recognised in OCI is recycled to 
profit or loss.
Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI (equity 
instruments)
Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify 
irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments 
designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the 
definition of equity under LKAS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is 
determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled 
to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in 
the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has 
been established, except when the Group benefits from such 
proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial 
asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity 
instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not 
subject to impairment assessment.
This category includes listed and non listed equity 
instruments that the Group elected to classify irrevocably.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include 
financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated 
upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, 
or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at 
fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if 
they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing 
in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded 
derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they 
are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial 
assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of 
principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value 
through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. 
Notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be 
classified at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, as 
described above, debt instruments may be designated at fair 
value through profit or loss on initial recognition if doing so 
eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried 
in the statement of financial position at fair value with net 
changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or 
loss.
This category includes derivative instruments and listed 
equity investments which the Group had not irrevocably 
elected to classify at fair value through OCI. Dividends on 
listed equity investments are also recognised as other income 
in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment 
has been established.
A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, with a financial 
liability or non-financial host, is separated from the host 
and accounted for as a separate derivative if: the economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related to the host; a 
separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded 
derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and 
the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through 
profit or loss. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair 
value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. 
Reassessment only occurs if there is either a change in the 
terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash 
flows that would otherwise be required or a reclassification 
of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss 
category.
(i-iii) Fair value measurement
SLFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be 
received to sell and asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transactions between market participants at the 
measurement date.
A Fair value measurement requires an entity to determine all 
the following;
1.  The particular asset or liability that is the subject of the 
measurement.
2.  For a non-financial asset, the valuation premise that is 
appropriate for the measurement (consistently with its 
highest and best use).
3.  The principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset 
or liability.
134 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
4.  The valuation technique(s) appropriate for the 
measurement, considering the availability of data with 
which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions 
that market participants would use when pricing the asset 
or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy within 
which the inputs are categorised.
5.  Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-
specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, 
observable market transactions or market.
When transaction price provides the best evidence of 
fair value at initial recognition, the financial instrument is 
initially measured at the transaction price and any difference 
between this price and the value initially obtained from a 
valuation model is subsequently recognised in profit or loss 
on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but 
not later than when the valuation is supported wholly by 
observable market data or the transaction is closed out.
Determination of Fair values
The determination of fair value for financial assets and 
liabilities for which there is no observable market price 
requires the use of valuation techniques. For financial 
instruments that trade infrequently and have little price 
transparency, fair value is less objective and requires varying 
degrees of judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, 
uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumption and other 
risks affecting the specific instrument.
Level 1 -  Fair value measurements using quoted prices 
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
Level 2 -  Fair value measurements using inputs other than 
quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e.,as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from 
prices);and
Level 3 -  Fair value measurements using inputs for the 
asset or liability that are not based on observable 
market data (i.e., unobservable inputs).
(i-iv)  Amortised cost
The amortised cost of a financial asset or liability is the 
amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured 
at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus 
or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective 
interest method of any difference between the initial amount 
recognised and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for 
impairment.
(i-v)  Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
Financial assets not classified at fair value through profit 
or loss, are assessed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired 
includes;
> default or delinquency by a debtor;
> restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms 
that the Group would not consider otherwise;
> indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy;
> adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or 
issuers;
> the disappearance of an active market for a security; or
> Observable data indicating that there is a measurable 
decrease in the expected cash flows from a group of 
financial assets.
In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a 
significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost 
is objective evidence of impairment.
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies 
a simplified approach in calculating Expected Credit Losses 
(ECLs). Therefore, the Group does not track changes in 
credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based 
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.The Group has 
established a provision metrix that is based on its historical 
credit loss experiance,adjusted for forward looking factors 
specific to the debtors and the economic environment.
The Group considers a financial asset in default when 
contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in 
certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial 
asset to be in default when internal or external information 
indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the oustanding 
contractual amounts in full before taking into account any 
credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset 
is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovering the contractual cash flows.
Investments in fixed deposits,Treasuray Bills and Bonds are 
considered as low risk of default.
Non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its non-financial assets (other than investment 
property, inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into 
the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows 
from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows of other assets or CGUs.
Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to 
CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 135
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of 
its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use 
is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss . They are 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 
For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been 
recognised.
(i-vi)  Hedge
For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective 
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is 
initially recognised directly in equity in the “cash flow hedge 
reserve”. The ineffective portion of the gains or losses on the 
hedge instrument is recognised immediately in the profit and 
loss.
When the hedge cash flow affect the Income Statement, 
the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in 
the corresponding income or expense line of the Income 
Statement. When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, 
terminated, exercised or when a hedge no longer meet the 
criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gains/losses 
existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains 
in other comprehensive income and is recognised in the 
income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur the cumulative gains/loss was reported in 
other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to 
the Income Statement.
(ii)  Financial liabilities
(ii-i)  Initial recognition and measurement
Financila Liabilities are classified,at initial recognition,as 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loanes and borrowings,payables, or as appropriate.All 
financialliabilities are recognised initially at fair value and , 
in the case of loans, borrowings and payables,net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and 
other payables loans and borrowing including bank 
overdrafts,lease liabilities,contract liablities and deferred 
income.
(ii-ii) Subsequent measurement
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (Loans and borrowings)
This is the category most relevant to the Group. After 
initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
EIR method, after considering any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the 
EIR. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when 
the liabilities are derecognised. EIR amortisation is included 
as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.
(ii)-(iii)  Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
(iii) Offseting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 
position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle 
on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets 
includes the cost of materials and direct labour and any other 
costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working 
condition for their intended use. Purchased software that 
is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is 
capitalised as part of that asset.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment 
have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and 
equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item 
if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied 
within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be 
measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of 
property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or 
loss.
(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, 
which is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted 
for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is recognised 
136 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant 
and equipment. In the year of acquisition depreciation is 
computed on proportionate basis from the month the asset 
is put into use and no depreciation will be charged to the 
month in which the particular asset was disposed. Leased 
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and 
their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group 
will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is 
not depreciated.
Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate
The estimated useful lives for the assets are as follows:
Freehold buildings 5 - 40 years
Submarine cables 10 - 25 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
CDMA handsets 3 years
PABX system 1-6 years
IT systems 5 - 10 years
Other fixed assets 2 - 12.5 years
Network equipment
Ducts ,cables and other outside plant 5 - 20 years
Telephone exchanges and transmission 
equipment
5 -12.5 years
Towers 40 years
(iv) Capital work-in-progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost net of accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. These are expenses of a capital 
nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, 
network equipment, system development and other fixed 
assets, awaiting capitalisation.
Major spare parts and project related inventory qualify as 
Property, plant and equipment when the entity expects to 
use them during more than one year period and are used 
in connection with specific items of Property, plant and 
equipment.
(v) Derecognition
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant & 
equipment is derecognised on disposal.Gains and losses 
on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are 
determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with 
the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and 
are recognised net within “other income” in the statement of 
Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.
When replacement costs are recognised in the carrying 
amount of an item of property, Plant and Equipment, 
the remaining carrying amount of the replaced part is 
derecognised. Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each 
such capitalisation, the remaining carrying amount of the 
previous cost of inspections is derecognised.
(vi)  Borrowing cost
Borrowing cost directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 
a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use 
or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective 
assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period 
they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other 
costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds.
(e) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is 
included in intangible assets. For measurement of goodwill 
at initial recognition, see note 3 (a) (i)
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses.
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, 
which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses.
(iii) Licenses
Separately acquired licences are shown at historical cost. 
Expenditures on license fees that is deemed to benefit or 
relate to more than one financial year is classified as license 
fee and is being amortised over the License period on a 
straight line basis.
(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases 
the future economic benefits embodied in the specific 
asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including 
expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised 
in profit or loss as incurred.
(f) Right of use assets and lease liabilities
Leases
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract 
is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration.
Group as a lessee
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 137
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes 
the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct 
costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives received. 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful 
lives of the assets, as follows:
Leased assets Estimated useful lives
Buildings 2-3 years
Towers 2-3 years
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at 
the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise 
of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are 
also subject to impairment as more fully described in Note 3 
(v)-(iii) - Impairment of Assets.
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of 
lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease 
payments include fixed payments (including in-substance 
fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, 
and amounts expected to be paid under residual value 
guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise 
price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating 
the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the 
option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not 
depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses 
(unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the 
period in which the event or condition that triggers the 
payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement 
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect 
the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 
remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease 
term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to 
future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate 
used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the 
assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.
The Group’s lease liabilities are included in rights-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities in Note 14.(a) to the Financial 
Statements.
Leases of low-value assets
The Group applies the lease of low-value assets recognition 
exemption to leases of some tower rentals that are 
considered to be low value.Lease payments on leases of 
low-value assets are recognised as expenses on straight -line 
basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset 
are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms 
and is included in revenue in the statement of profit or loss 
due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in 
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. 
Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in 
which they are earned.
(g) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the 
weighted average cost principle.Value of inventories includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring, conversion costs and other 
costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and 
condition.
(h) Share capital
Ordinary Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share 
options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any 
tax effects.
(i) Government grants
Government grants are recognised initially at fair value when 
there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and 
the Group will comply with the conditions associated with 
the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses 
incurred are recognised in the statement of Profit or Loss 
and Other Comprehensive Income as other income on a 
systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses 
are recognised. Grants that compensate the Group for the 
cost of an asset are recognised in the of profit or loss on a 
systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.
(j) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit 
plan under which contributions are made into a separate 
fund and the entity will have no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for 
contributions to defined contribution plan are recognised as 
an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods 
during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a 
cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
138 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
Employees’ Provident Fund
All employees of the Company are members of the Sri Lanka 
Telecom Provident Fund to which the Company contributes 
15% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances.
All employees of subsidiaries of the Group are members of 
Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), to which the respective 
subsidiaries contribute 12% of such employees’ basic salary 
and allowances. Employees of Sri lanka Telecom (Services) 
Limited are members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), 
where the company contribute 15% of such employees’ basic 
salary and allowances.
Employees’ Trust Fund
The Company and other subsidiaries contribute 3% of the 
salary of each employee to the Employees’ Trust Fund.
(ii) Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan 
other than a defined contribution plan. The defined benefit 
is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit 
Credit method as recommended by LKAS 19 “Employee 
Benefits” The present value of the defined benefit obligation 
is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows using the yield on Government Bonds at the 
reporting date and have maturity dates approximating to the 
terms of the Company’s obligations.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses that arise 
in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect of a plan 
in other comprehensive income. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation depends on a number of factors 
that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number 
of assumptions. Key assumptions used in determining the 
defined retirement benefit obligations are given in Note 28. 
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying 
amount of defined benefit obligations.
Provision has been made for retirement gratuities from the 
first year of service for all employees, in conformity with 
LKAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. However, under the Payment 
of Gratuity Act No.12 of 1983, the liability to an employee 
arises only on completion of five years of continued service.
(iii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when 
the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic 
possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either 
terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or 
to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made 
to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits 
for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if 
the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is 
probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of 
acceptances can be estimated reliably.
(iv) Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an 
undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service 
is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid 
under short-term cash bonus or leave encashment plans if 
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to 
pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the 
employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
(k) Revenue from contracts with customers
The Group is primarily involved in providing a broad 
portfolio of telecommunication services across Sri Lanka. 
In addition, the range of services provided by the Group 
include, inter allia, voice and broadband services, domestic 
and international leased circuits, broadband, satellite up-link, 
maritime transmission, IPTV service, directory publishing 
service and educational services.
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when 
control of the goods or services are transferred to the 
customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to 
which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those 
goods or services. The Group has generally concluded that it 
is the principal in its revenue arrangements.
(i)  Performance obligations relevant to contacts
As a telecommunication service provider, the Group’s 
performance obligation related to service contracts include 
the installation services and maintenance services provided 
and the uninterrupted telecommunication service which will 
be provided throughout the connection period.
The Group expects that above performance obligations 
would be satisfied throughout the connection period.
Domestic and international call revenue and rental income
Fixed lines
Revenue for call time usage by customers is recognised as 
revenue as services are performed on accrual basis. Fixed 
rental is recognised as income on a monthly basis in relation 
to the period of services rendered.
Mobile revenue
Mobile revenue comprises amounts charged to customers in 
respect of monthly access charges, airtime usage, messaging, 
and the provision of other mobile telecommunications 
services. Mobile monthly access charges are invoiced and 
recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle. Air time, either 
from contract customers as part of the invoiced amount or 
from prepaid customers through the sale of prepaid cards, 
is recorded in the period in which the customer uses the 
service.
Revenue from other network operators and international 
settlements
The revenue received from other network operators, 
local and international, for the use of the Group’s 
telecommunication network are recognised, net of taxes, 
based on usage taking the traffic minutes/per second rates 
stipulated in the relevant agreements and regulations and 
based on the terms of the lease agreements for fixed rentals.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 139
Revenue arising from the interconnection of voice and 
data traffic between other telecommunications operators is 
recognised at the time of transit across the Group’s network 
and presented on gross basis. The relevant revenue accrued 
is recognised under income in the Income Statement and 
interconnection expenses recognised under operating costs 
in profit or loss.
Revenue from broadband
Revenue from Data services and IPTV services is recognised 
on usage and the fixed rental on a monthly basis when it is 
earned net of taxes, rebates and discounts.
Revenue from other ICT services
The revenue from other telephone services are recognised 
on an accrual basis based on fixed rental contracts entered 
between the Group and subscribers.
Recognision of deferred income
The connection fees relating to Public Switch Telephone 
Network (PSTN) are deferred over a period of 15 years. 
Revenue is recognised on an annual basis irrespective of the 
date of connection.
IRU revenue relating to leasing of SEA-ME-WE 4 cable 
capacity are recognised on a straight line basis over the 
period of the contracts. Amounts received in advance for any 
services are recorded as deferred revenue. In the event that a 
customer terminates an IRU prior to the expiry of the contract 
and releases the Company from the obligation to provide 
future services, the remaining unamortised deferred revenue 
is recognised in the period the contract is terminated.
Backhauling revenue which is leasing of SEA-ME-WE 3 cable 
capacity is recognised on a straight line basis over the period 
of contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services 
are recorded as deferred revenue.
Revenue from the sale of prepaid CDMA cards is deferred 
until such time as the customer uses the call time, 
downloadable quota or the credit expires.
Sale of mobile recharge cards and reloads for prepaid 
subscribers are initially recognised as deferred revenue until 
such time as the subscribers use the services or credit period 
expires.
CDMA revenue
The connection fees relating to Code Divisional Multiple 
Access (CDMA) connections are recognised as revenue at the 
point the connection is activated.
(ii)  New connection fees
The Group provides installation services relevant to the new 
connections of fixed and mobile telecommunication services 
including both voice and non-voice categories. These 
installation services are bundled together with providing 
of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) to customers 
in fixed line voice and some non-voice services. When 
the performance obligations relevant to such installation 
services are performed, CPEs provided to customers are 
considered as assets of the Group as long as the contracts 
with customers are valid. Accordingly, the Group allocates a 
bundled price for the equipment and installation services for 
such facilities.
(iii)  Recognision of contract liabilities
The Group concluded that revenue from new connections 
in fixed and mobile telecommunication services is to be 
recognised over time because the customer simultaneously 
receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group. 
The fact that another entity would not need to reperform 
the installation of the service that the Group has provided to 
date demonstrates that the customer simultaneously receives 
and consumes the benefits of the Group’s performance as it 
performs.
The Group identifies the revenue for installation services as a 
contract liability and recognises the revenue on a systematic 
basis that is consistent with the entity’s transfer of the related 
goods or services to the customer since satisfaction for the 
installation services will be consumed by the customer over 
the contract period.
(iv)  Costs incurred in securing customer contracts
The Group identifies the sales commission paid to sales team 
for each new connection contract and other such related 
costs in contract acquisition as costs incurred in securing 
customer contracts.
(v)  Recognision of contract assets
Contract acquisition costs are recognised as a contract asset 
and subsequently recognised as an expense over the life of a 
contract on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of 
the transfer of services to which the asset relates, that is; as 
and when the relevant performance obligation is fulfilled for 
a given month.
(l)  Expenditure
The expenses are recognised on an accrual basis. All 
expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business and 
in maintaining property, plant and equipment in a state of 
efficiency is charged against income in arriving at the profit 
for the year
(m)  Lease payments
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are 
apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction 
of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated 
to each period during the lease term so as to produce a 
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability.
Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising 
the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the 
lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed. Determining 
whether an arrangement contains a lease.
140 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines 
whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A 
specific asset is the subject of a lease if fulfillment of the 
arrangement is dependent on the use of that specific asset. 
An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the 
arrangement conveys to the Group the right to control the 
use of the underlying asset.
(n)  Finance income and expenses
The Group’s finance income and finance cost include:
> Interest income from repurchase agreements
> Interest income from fixed deposits
> Staff loan interest income
> Interest expense from borrowings
> Interest expense arising from Leases
> Foreign exchange gains or losses
Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective 
interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit 
or loss on the date on which the Group’s right to receive 
payment is established.
(o)  Income tax
Current income tax assets are measured at amount to be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities
(i)  Current taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognised or profit or loss except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly 
in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other 
comprehensive income.
Provisions for taxation is based on the profit for the year 
adjusted for taxation purposes in accordance with the 
provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 and the 
amendments thereto.
(ii)  Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised 
for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss and differences relating to investments in nor 
taxable profit or loss and differences relating to investments 
in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred 
tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied 
to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity 
or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current 
tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets 
liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax 
is not recognised for the undistributed profits of subsidiaries 
as the Parent Company has control over the dividend policy 
of its subsidiaries and distribution of those profits. Deferred 
tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the 
related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or 
loss, is recognised either in other comprehensive income or 
directly in Statement of Changes in Equity in line with the 
underlying transaction.
(iii)  Economic Service Charge (ESC)
ESC is payable on the liable turnover at specified rates. 
As per the provision of the Economic Service Charge Act 
No. 13 of 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto, ESC 
is deductible from the income tax liability. Any unclaimed 
payment can be carried forward and set off against the 
income tax payable as per the relevant provision in the Act.
With effective from 1 January 2020 the Act mentioned above 
was abolished.
(iv)  Sales tax
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the 
amount of sale tax, except: where sales tax incurred on a 
purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the 
taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised 
as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of 
expense item as applicable.
(v)  Uncertainty over income tax treatment
The Group determines whether to consider each uncertain 
tax treatment separately or together with one or more other 
uncertain tax treatments and uses the approach that better 
predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.
The Group applies significant judgment in identifying 
uncertainties over income tax treatments and it assessed 
whether the interpretation had an impact on its consolidated 
Financial Statements.
If the Group concludes that it is probable that the taxation 
authority will accept the tax treatment used or planned to be 
used in its tax fillings, the entity determines its tax position 
on that basis. This is consistent with the requirement that 
current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid 
or recovered from the taxation authorities, and that deferred 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 141
tax is measured using the rates and tax laws expected to 
apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled.
If the Group concludes that acceptance of the uncertain tax 
treatment by the taxation authorities is not probable, it would 
apply one of the following two methods for reflecting the 
effect of uncertainty in its estimate of the amount it expects 
to pay or recover from the tax authorities
a.  the most likely amount - the single most likely amount in 
a range of possible outcomes; or
b.  the expected value - thesum of the probability-weighted 
amounts in a range of possible outcomes.
The Group uses the method that is expects to better predict 
the resolution of the uncertainty.
(p)  Earnings per share
The Group presents basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) data for 
its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the 
profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the 
company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determinated by adjusting the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-
average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the 
effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
(q)  Insurance reserve
The Company transfers annually from the retained earnings 
an amount equal to 0.1% of additions to property, plant 
and equipment to an insurance reserve. An equal amount is 
invested in a sinking fund to meet any funding requirements 
for potential losses from uninsured property, plant and 
equipment. The insurance reserve is maintained to recover 
any losses arising from damage to property, plant and 
equipment, except for motor vehicles, that are not insured 
with a third party insurer.
(r)  Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is 
recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements 
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
Provision for final dividends is recognised at the time the 
dividend recommended and declared by the Board of 
Directors, is approved by the shareholders.
(s)  Comparatives
Except when a standard permits or requires otherwise, 
comparative information is disclosed in respect of the 
previous period. Where the presentation or classification of 
items in the Financial Statements are amended, comparative 
amounts are reclassified unless it is impracticable.
(t)  Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows has been prepared using the 
‘indirect method’ of preparing cash flows in accordance with 
the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard (LKAS 07) – ‘Statement 
of Cash Flows’. Cash and Cash equivalents comprise short-
term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant 
risk of change in value. The cash and cash equivalent include 
cash in hand, balances with banks, placements with banks, 
money at call and short notice.
(u)  Non-current assets held for sale
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups 
as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups 
classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell 
are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal 
of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs and 
income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as 
met only when the sale is highly probable, and the asset or 
disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition. Actions required to complete the sale should 
indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale 
will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. 
Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset 
and the sale expected to be completed within one year from 
the date of the classification.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not 
depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. 
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented 
separately as current items in the statement of financial 
position.
Additional disclosures are provided in Note 22.
(v)  Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and 
judgements
In the preparation of these Financial Statements, a number of 
estimates and assumptions have been made relating to the 
performance and the financial position of the Group. Results 
may differ significantly from those estimates under different 
assumptions and conditions. The Directors consider that the 
following discussion addresses the Company’s most critical 
accounting policies, which are those that are most important 
to the presentation of its financial performance and position. 
These particular policies require subjective and complex 
judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates 
about the effect of matters that are uncertain.
(i)  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
The Company assigns useful lives and residual values to 
property, plant and equipment based on periodic studies 
of actual asset lives and the intended use for those assets. 
Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, 
142 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of 
the assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives or 
residual values differing from initial estimates.
Where the Company determines that the useful life of 
property, plant and equipment should be shortened or 
residual value reduced, it depreciates the net carrying 
amount in excess of the residual value over the revised 
remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation 
expense. Any change in an asset’s life or residual value is 
reflected in the Company’s Financial Statements when the 
change in estimate is determined.
(ii)  Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets
The Company assesses the impairment of property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting 
standards. Factors that are considered important and which 
could trigger an impairment review include the following;
a.  obsolescence or physical damage;
b.  significant changes in technology and regulatory 
environments;
c.  significant underperformance relative to expected 
historical or projected future operating results;
d.  significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy 
for its overall business;
The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of 
future cash flows and the determination of the recoverable 
amount for assets or cash generating units require significant 
judgement.
(iii)  Revenue recognition
Judgement is required in assessing the application of the 
principles of revenue recognition in respect of revenues. This 
includes presentation of revenue as principal or as agent 
in respect of income received from transmission of content 
provided by third parties.
(iv)  Valuation of receivables
The provision for impairment losses for trade and other 
receivables reflects the Company’s estimates of losses arising 
from the failure or inability of customers to make required 
payments. The provision is based on the ageing of customer 
accounts, customer credit-worthiness and the Company’s 
historical write-off experience etc. Changes to the provision 
may be required if the financial condition of its customers 
improves or deteriorates. An improvement in financial 
condition may result in lower actual write-offs.
(v) Inventories
The Company assesses the inventory provision whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable or otherwise as required by 
accounting standards. Factors that are considered important 
and which could trigger an impairment review include the 
following;
a.  obsolescence or physical damage;
b.  significant changes in technology and regulatory 
environments;
c.  significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy 
for its overall business;
(vi) Current tax and deferred tax
Judgement was required to determine the total provision for 
current, deferred and other taxes due to uncertainties that 
exist with respect to the interpretation of the applicability 
of tax law at the time of the preparation of these financial 
statements.
Certain uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation 
of tax regulations and the amount and timing of future 
taxable income. Differences arising between the actual 
results and the assumptions made, or future changes to 
such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to 
tax income and expense already recorded. Where the final 
tax outcome of such matters is different from the amounts 
that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the 
income and deferred tax amounts in the period in which the 
determination is made.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, 
based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
(vii) Leases-estimating the incremental borrowing rate
The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit 
in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing 
rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of 
interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a 
similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary 
to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use 
asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore 
reflects what the Group “would have to pay”, which requires 
estimation when no observable rates are available or when 
they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions 
of the lease. The Group estimates the IBR using observable 
inputs such as market interest rates when available and is 
required to make certain entity-specific estimates as well.
(viii) Revenue recognision from contracts with customers
Judgement is required in assessing the application 
of the principles of revenue recognition in respect of 
revenues.Certain contracts with customers are bundled 
packages that may include sale of products and 
telecommunications services that comprise voice, data, and 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 143
other telecommunications services. The Group accounts 
for individual products and services separately as separate 
performance obligations if they are distinct promised 
goods and services. The Group exercises judgements in 
determining whether a product is distinct, that is, if such 
product or service is separately identifiable from other items 
in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from 
it separately. This determination will affect the allocation 
of consideration specified in the contract and the revenue 
recognised for each performance obligation.
(ix)  Assets held for sale
On 14 December 2021, the Group publicly announced the 
decision of its Board of Directors to sell SLT Campus (Pvt) Ltd, 
a wholly owned subsidiary. Operations of SLT Campus (Pvt) 
Ltd are classified as a disposal group held for sale. The Board 
considered the subsidiary to meet the criteria to be classified 
as held for sale at that date for the following reasons:
> SLT Campus (Pvt) Ltd is available for immediate sale and 
can be sold to the buyer in its current condition
> The actions to complete the sale were initiated and 
expected to be completed within one year from the date 
of initial classification
> A potential buyer has been identified and negotiations as 
at the reporting date are at the conclusion stage.
> The shareholders approved the plan to sell on 14 
December 2021. For more details refer to Note 22. 
(w)  Amendments to existing accounting standards
The Group applied for the first-time certain amendments, to 
existing accounting standards, which are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. The Group 
has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or 
amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
(i) Amendments to SLFRS 16 Leases: Covid-19-Related 
Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021
In 4 December 2020, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued Covid-19-Related Rent 
Concessions - amendment to SLFRS 16 Leases. The 
amendments provide relief to lessees from applying SLFRS 
16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent 
concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 
pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not 
to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from 
a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this 
election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting 
from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same way 
it would account for the change under SLFRS 16, if the 
change were not a lease modification. The amendment was 
intended to apply until 30 June 2021, but as the impact of 
the Covid-19 pandemic is continuing, in 28 June 2021, CA 
Sri Lanka extended the period of application of the practical 
expedient to 30 June 2022.The amendment applies to 
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2021. 
(ii)  Amendments to SLFRS 9, LKAS 39, SLFRS 7, SLFRS 4 and 
SLFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 1 and 2
IBOR reform Phase 1
In 15 January 2021, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued amendments to SLFRS 
9, LKAS 39 and SLFRS 7 due to Interest Rate Benchmark 
Reform (Phase 1). A summary of Phase 1 amendments are as 
follows:
> Highly Probable Requirement: According to SLFRS 9 and 
LKAS 39, when a forecast transaction is designated as a 
hedged item, that transaction must be highly probable 
to occur. By the Phase 1 amendments, when determining 
whether a forecast transaction is highly probable, an 
entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on 
which the hedged cashflows are based is not altered as a 
result of the reform
> Prospective assessments: A hedging relationship qualifies 
for hedge accounting only if there is an economic 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument (described in SLFRS 9) or the hedge is 
expected to be highly effective in achieving off-setting 
(described in LKAS 39). An entity must demonstrate 
such prospective assessments on a regular basis. By the 
Phase 1 amendments, when performing prospective 
assessments, an entity shall assume that the interest rate 
benchmark on which the hedged item, hedged risk and/
or hedging instrument are based is not altered as a result 
of the interest rate benchmark reform
LKAS 39 retrospective assesment: To apply hedge 
accounting under LKAS 39, an entity must demonstrate that 
the actual results of the hedge are within a range of 80% - 
125%. This requirement is commonly known as the ‘LKAS 39 
retrospective assesment’. By the Phase 1 amendments, an 
entity is not required to undertake the LKAS 39 retrospective 
assesment for hedging relationships directly affected by 
the reform. However, the entity must comply with all other 
LKAS 39 hedge accounting requirements, including the 
prospective assesment
> Separately identifiable risk components: While there 
are some differences between SLFRS 9 and LKAS 
39 regarding designation of risk components, both 
Standards require a risk component (or a portion) to 
be separately identifiable to be eligible for hedge 
accounting. An entity may designate an item in its 
entirety or a component of an item as a hedged item in 
a hedging relationship. SLFRS 9 and LKAS 39 require the 
component to be separately identifiable to qualify as a 
hedged item. By the Phase 1 amendments, for hedges 
of non-contractually specified benchmark component 
of interest rate risk, an entity shall apply the separately 
identifiable requirement only at the inception of such 
hedging relationships

IBOR reform Phase 2
In addition to Phase 1 amendments, CA Sri Lanka also issued 
amendments to SLFRS 9, LKAS 39, SLFRS 7, SLFRS 4 and 
SLFRS 16 due to Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. The Phase 
2 amendments provide temporary reliefs which address the 
financial reporting effects when an interbank offered rate 
(IBOR) is replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free interest 
rate (RFR). The amendments include the following practical 
expedients 
> A practical expedient to require contractual changes, or 
changes to cash flows that are directly required by the 
reform, to be treated as changes to A floating interest 
rate, equivalent to A movement in A market rate of 
interest
> Permit changes required by IBOR reform to be made to 
hedge designations and hedge documentation without 
the hedging relationship being discontinued.
> Provide temporary relief to entities from having to meet 
the separately identifiable requirement when an RFR 
instrument is designated as a hedge of a risk component
The effective date of both IBOR reform Phase 1 and Phase 2 
amendments is for annual reporting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2021 in the Sri Lankan context
The requirements under phase 1 amendments have to be 
applied retrospectively. However, the reliefs only apply 
to hedging relationships that existed at the beginning of 
the reporting period in which an entity first applies those 
requirements or were designated thereafter, and to the 
amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve that 
existed at the beginning of the reporting period in which 
an entity first applies those requirements. It follows that it 
is not possible to apply the reliefs retrospectively to hedge 
relationships that were not previously designated as such
The requirements under phase 2 amendments have to 
be applied retrospectively. Hedge relationships are not 
designated retrospectively. However, discontinued hedging 
relationships must be reinstated if, and only if,
> The hedging relationship was discontinued solely due 
to changes required by the Reform, and, therefore, the 
entity would not have been required to discontinue that 
hedging relationship if the Phase 2 Amendments had 
been applied at that time and
> At the date of initial application of the Phase 2 
Amendments, that discontinued hedge relationship 
continues to meet all the qualifying criteria for hedge 
accounting, after taking account of the Phase 2 
Amendment.
These amendmends had no material impact on the financial 
statements. We intend to apply these amendments in future 
periods if they become applicable.
(x) Standards issued but not yet effective
The new and amended standards and interpretations that are 
issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the 
Group’s Financial Statements are disclosed below. The Group 
intends to adopt these new and amended standards and 
interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective.
(i)  SLFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts - In 8 January 2020, 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA 
Sri Lanka) issued SLFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (SLFRS 
17). SLFRS 17 was amended by Amendments to SLFRS 
17 - Insurance Contracts, in 28 June 2021. SLFRS 17 is a 
comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance 
contracts covering recognition and measurement, 
presentation and disclosure. Once effective, SLFRS 17 
will replace SLFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (SLFRS 4) that 
was issued in 2005. SLFRS 17 applies to all types of 
insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance 
and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that 
issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial 
instruments with discretionary participation features. A 
few scope exceptions will apply. The overall objective of 
SLFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance 
contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In 
contrast to the requirements in SLFRS 4, which are largely 
based on grandfathering previous local accounting 
policies, SLFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for 
insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting 
aspects. The core of SLFRS 17 is the general model, 
supplemented by:
> A specific adaptation for contracts with direct 
participation features (the variable fee approach)
> A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) 
mainly for short-duration contracts
SLFRS 17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2023, with comparative figures 
required. Early application is permitted, provided the entity 
also applies SLFRS 9 and SLFRS 15 on or before the date it 
first applies SLFRS 17.
SLFRS 17 - Insurance contracts is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements.”
(ii) Amendments to LKAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets : Onerous Contracts – Costs of 
Fulfilling a Contract
In 25 March 2021, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued amendments to LKAS 37 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets 
(LKAS 37) to specify which costs an entity needs to include 
when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. 
The amendments apply a “directly related cost approach”. 
The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 145
or services include both incremental costs and an allocation 
of costs directly related to contract activities. General and 
administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract 
and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to 
the counterparty under the contract. The amendments are 
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2022. Earlier application is permitted.
This amendment is not expected to have a significant impact 
on Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
(iii) Amendments to LKAS 16 Property, Plant & Equipment : 
Proceeds before Intended Use
In 25 March 2021, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued LKAS 16 Property, Plant and 
Equipment — Proceeds before Intended Use, which prohibits 
entities deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant 
and equipment, any proceeds from selling items produced 
while bringing that asset to the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by management. Instead, an entity recognizes the 
proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing 
those items, in profit or loss
The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2022 and must be applied 
retrospectively to items of property, plant and equipment 
made available for use on or after the beginning of the 
earliest period presented when the entity first applies the 
amendment
This amendment is not expected to have a significant impact 
on Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
(iv) Amendments to SLFRS 3 Business Combinations : 
Updating a reference to conceptual framework
In 23 March 2021, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued amendments to SLFRS 
3 Business Combinations - Updating a Reference to the 
Conceptual Framework. The amendments are intended to 
replace a reference to the Framework for the Preparation 
and Presentation of Financial Statements, issued in 1989, 
with a reference to the Conceptual Framework for Financial 
Reporting issued in March 2018 without significantly 
changing its requirements.
An exception was also added to the recognition principle of 
SLFRS 3 to avoid the issue of potential ‘day 2’ gains or losses 
arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be 
within the scope of LKAS 37 or IFRIC 21 Levies, if incurred 
separately
At the same time, it was decided to clarify existing guidance 
in SLFRS 3 for contingent assets that would not be affected 
by replacing the reference to the Framework for the 
Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements
The amendments are effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 and apply 
prospectively. This amendment is not expected to have 
a significant impact on Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements.”
(v)  SLFRS 1 First-time Adoption of Sri Lanka Financial 
Reporting Standards – Subsidiary as a first-time adopter
As part of its 2018-2020 annual improvements to SLFRS 
standards process, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued an amendment to SLFRS 
1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards (SLFRS 1). The amendment permits a subsidiary 
that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of SLFRS 1 to measure 
cumulative translation differences using the amounts 
reported by the parent, based on the parent’s date of 
transition to SLFRS. This amendment is also applied to an 
associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph 
D16(a) of SLFRS 1. The amendment is effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with 
earlier adoption permitted. This amendment is not expected 
to have a significant impact on Group’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
(vi) SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Fees in the ’10 per cent’ 
test for derecognition of financial liabilities
As part of its 2018-2020 annual improvements to SLFRS 
standards process, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued an amendment to SLFRS 
9 Financial Instruments (SLFRS 9). The amendment clarifies 
the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the 
terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially 
different from the terms of the original financial liability. 
These fees include only those paid or received between the 
borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received 
by either the borrower or lender on the other’s behalf. An 
entity applies the amendment to financial liabilities that 
are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of 
the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies 
the amendment. The amendment is effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with 
earlier adoption permitted.
This amendment is not expected to have a significant impact 
on Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
(vii) LKAS 41 Agriculture – Taxation in fair value 
measurements
As part of its 2018-2020 annual improvements to SLFRS 
standards process, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued an amendment to LKAS 
41 Agriculture (LKAS 41). The amendment removes the 
requirement in paragraph 22 of LKAS 41 that entities exclude 
cash flows for taxation when measuring the fair value of 
assets within the scope of LKAS 41. An entity applies the 
amendment prospectively to fair value measurements on 
146 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period 
beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with earlier adoption 
permitted.
This amendment is not expected to have a significant impact 
on Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
4.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the 
establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management 
framework.
The Group’s risk management processes are established 
to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set 
appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and 
adherence to limits. Risk management systems are reviewed 
regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the 
group activities.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors 
compliance with the Group’s risk management processes/
guidelines and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the 
risk management framework in relation to the risks. The Audit 
Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal reviews 
of risk management controls and procedures. The results of 
which are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of 
financial instruments:
> Credit risk, Liquidity risk and Market risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to 
each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives , policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s 
management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are 
included throughout these financial statements.
4.1.  Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a 
customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligation, and arise principally from the 
Group’s receivables from customers.
Carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum 
credit exposure
4.1.1  Trade receivables
The group having a very well established credit policy for 
both International Interconnect customers and Domestic 
customers to minimize the credit risk. A separate committee 
has been established to evaluate and recommend the credit 
worthiness for the International Interconnect customer. 
Further, Prepaid sales are used as a means of mitigating 
credit risk
Domestic service is offered to a new customer only after 
scrutinizing through a internal blacklisted data base. The 
group has a well-established credit control policy & process 
to minimize the credit risk. Customers are categorised 
according to the segments and credit limit has been fixed 
as per their average monthly bill value. Customer usage and 
bill payments are monitored as per the credit limit. Credit 
limit will be periodically revised as per the past monthly 
bill value. High risk voice customers are subjected to auto 
disconnection when they reached the threshold limit. Credit 
control actions and recovery actions are taken for the 
overdue customers and defaulted customers to minimise 
the credit risk. High revenue generated customers including 
corporate customers are monitored individually.
As at 31 December, the maximum exposure to credit risk for 
trade by geographic region was as follows:

4.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTD.
4.2  Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities 
that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as 
possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, 
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by investing in short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support 
operational and other funding requirements. The group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and 
long-term cash forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding 
adequacy for at least a 12-month period and the same is reviewed on an annual basis.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the Treasury Division.
Contractual undiscounted payments the Sri Lanka Telecom PLC would be called upon to make under the issued Corporate 
Guarantee Contracts on behalf of its subsidiaries are as follows,

4.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTD.
4.3  Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which will 
affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to 
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
4.3.1  Currecny risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on services provided, services received and borrowings that are denominated in a 
currency other than the Sri Lankan rupees (Rs.) 
The Group manages its currency risk by a natural hedging mechanism to a certain extent by matching currency outflows for 
repayments of foreign currency loans and services with currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies.
The summary of quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to foreign currency was as follows:

Sensitivity analysis
A reasonable possible strengthening (weakening) USD would have an impact on the Group’s borrowings. This analysis assumes 
that all other variables, in particular interest rates remain constant.

4.3.2  Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk mainly arises as a result of Group having interest sensitive assets and liabilities, which are directly, impacted 
by changes in the interest rates. The Group’s borrowings and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest 
rate instruments and periodical maturity gap analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse 
impact due to volatility of the interest rates. 
To minimise the adverse impact of variable interest rate borrowings due to an upward movement of USD interest rates in the 
market, the Company has obtained an interest rate SWAP and arrangements are being made to obtain an interets rate CAP .
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operations while long-term interest rate management 
decisions require approval from the Board of Directors.
Interest rate sensitivity of the company was computed within the floor interest rate (Minimum) of 2.5% as stipulated in the loan 
agreement. The Group interest rate sensitivity was computed based on a 100 basis point increase or decrease. This analysis 
assumes that all other variables, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The sensitivity of interest rate 
movement is shown below;

4.4  Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. Capital consists of stated capital and reserves The Board of Directors monitors the return 
on capital as well as the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

5.  OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. The strategic 
divisions offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and 
marketing strategies for each of the strategic divisions, the Board of Directors, (the Chief Operating Decision Maker-CODM) 
reviews internal management reports on at least quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of 
the Group’s reportable segments.
> Fixed ICT operations includes supply of fixed telecommunication services.
> Mobile ICT operations includes supply of mobile telecommunication services.
> Other segment operations includes directory publication and support services. None of these segments meet the 
quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2021 or 2020.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment 
profit before tax. As included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors (BOD). Segment 
profit is used to measure performance as Management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the 
results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.

8   REFUNDS ON TELECOMMUNICATION DEVELOPMENT  CHARGE (TDC)
In accordance with the Finance Act No. 11 of 2004, all Telecommunication Gateway Operators are required to pay a levy 
defined as the Telecommunication Development Charge (TDC) to the Government of Sri Lanka, based on international call 
minutes terminated in the country. This levy was   made effective from 03 March, 2003 where initially the levy was defined in 
such a way that Operators were allowed to claim the 2/3rd of the TDC against the costs of network development charges.
The TDC Refund received in 2014 corresponds to the period from April 2009 to July 2010 which was the last claim obtained 
under the respective regulation. As the said regulation was received with effect from July 2010 while eliminating the 
reimbursement process, the final claim requested from TRC applicable for the above period was received in year 2014.
First revision to this regulation was introduced with effect from 15 July, 2010 with an International Telecommunication 
Operators Levy (ITOL) TDC rate change from USD cents 3.80 to USD cents 1.50. Through the same revision, the disbursement 
process of TDC was removed from the regulation. As stated above the revised ITOL rate prevailed until such time the rate was 
revised to USD cents 3.00 per minute with effect from January 2012, in accordance with the Budget Proposal for 2012 and 
ITOL rate was further revised again to USD cents 6.00 per minute with effect from January 2016 in accordance with the Budget 
Proposal for 2016.

Hedging activities         
The Group is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The Group uses foreign currency-
denominated borrowings to manage some of its transaction exposures. The primary risks managed using hedging activities is 
the foreign currency risk.
The Group’s risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage foreign currency risk are explained in Note 4.3.1.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments as there is an opposite relationship 
between currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies which are generated from day-to-day business operations 
and currency outflows for repayments of foreign currency loans which are on fixed terms.
The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the foreign exchange are 
identical to the hedged risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method 
and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the changes in fair value of the hedged items 
attributable to the hedged risks.
The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
> Differences in the timing of the cash flows of the hedged items and the hedging instruments
> Changes to the forecasted amount of cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments
13 EARNINGS PER SHARE

The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows:
 Group  Company 
2021 2020 2021 2020 
Discount rate  (long-term) - % 10.6 - 11.6 8.0-10.0 10.6 8.0

Expected average working life of employees - Years 11.7 -13.4 9.9-12.3 13.4 12.3
Retirement age of the employees - Years 55-60 55-60 55-60 55-60
In addition to above, demographic assumptions such as mortality, withdrawal, retirement age were considered for the actuarial 
valuation. In 2021,1967/70 Mortality Table issued by the Institute of Actuaries London (2020 - 1967/70 Mortality Table) was 
taken as the base for the valuation.
The provisions for defined obligations of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC,SLT Digital Info Services  (Private) Limited, Sri Lanka Telecom 
(Services) Limited,SLT Campus (Private) Limited,SLT Visioncom (Private) Limited, Talentfort (Private) Limited and Mobitel 
(Private) Limited , are actuarially valued by Messrs Actuarial and Management Consultants (Private) Limited and Messrs Piyal S 
Goonetilleke and Associates respectively.
The provision for defined benefit obligations is not externally funded.  
Sensitivity analysis
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions 
constant,  would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amount shown below.
The sensitivity of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position is the 
effect of the assumed changes in discount rate and salary increment rate as depicted in the following table.

carrying amounts lastly due to the short term maturities of these investments.       
  
Fair value of trade and other payables and borrowings have been arrived by discounting gross values by the year end AWFDR rate.

financial Assets and Liabilities that have a short term maturity, it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate their fair 
values. 
Fixed rate financial instruments

rates when they were first recognized with current market rates for similar financial instruments
Variable rate financial instruments

variable rate instruments.

38 IMPACT OF COVID 19 - PANDEMIC
Significant unusual items affecting assets, liabilities, equity, net income or cash flows
The telecommunication service has been categorised as an essential service by the Government of Sri Lanka. With the 
responsibility to provide an uninterrupted service to the nation, SLT as the national telecommunications provider activated its 
Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”) and effected changes in operations, supply chain, workforce movements, investments and 
strategies to cope with the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The below summarises our strategy and the response plan for the pandemic situation:
(a)   Uninterrupted service to the nation while keeping people safe
As the national telecommunications and mobile services provider, SLT Group provided an uninterrupted service to the nation 
during this challenging period. SLT Group ensured customer service through digital platforms to minimize human contact and 
maintained social distancing and safety regulations in customer points. SLT Group shifted most of the employees to Work from 
Home and the employees who perform their duties in office premises/ field were allowed to work under strict health and safety 
guidelines while maintaining social distancing regulations. During the years 2020 and 2021, SLT created a fund to mitigate the 
cost of hospitalization, set up three intermediatory quarantine centers and provided home care medical facilities for detected 
SLT employees and their immediate family members. However, considering the new guidelines issued by the Government of 
Sri Lanka on Covid-19 management practices, SLT revised its Covid-19 incident handling protocol in the new normal situation 
and presently continues only with the provision of home care medical facilities. 
(b)   Direction of operations for the need of the hour 
As a response to the need of the hour, SLT together with its mobile arm Mobitel provided innovative yet affordable data 
packages to meet the growing customer demand and introduced easy payment terms for corporate customers. With the 
shift towards work from home arrangements and study from home arrangements, the Group experienced a positive impact in 
revenue in areas such as Broadband, PEOTV and Career Business services due to surge in utilization in both residential and 
business sectors. Further, future opportunities are emerging with novel digital products and services. 
(c)    Liquidity management 
The effective collection strategies of the Group coupled with the need for continuous supply of telecommunication services 
improved collections over the period. The Group prioritised capital expenditure for critical projects, which included projects 
which provide connectivity to rural areas to narrow the digital divide in the Country. However, the recent depreciation of the Sri 
Lankan rupee against the US dollar adversely impacted the cash flows of the Group. Further, the foreign currency liquidity issue 
prevailing in the domestic foreign exchange market poses challenges to project payments in foreign currency.
(d)   Impact on property, plant and equipment
The Group has assessed the impact on property, plant and equipment and spectrum assigned to the Group and does not 
foresee impairment due to the pandemic. 
The Group will continue to take proactive measures to mitigate any potential impact and will continue its contingency plans 
and risk management measures as the situation evolves. 
There were no other events or transactions that require disclosures or adjustments to the financial statements for the period 
ended 31 December 2021.

39 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE

be imposed on companies that have earned a taxable income in excess of LK Rs. 2,000 million for the year of assessment 
2020/2021. The proposed tax should be deemed an expenditure in the financial statements relating to the year of assessment

Our Reach
SL T provides island-wide coverage for fixed and 
mobile ICT services, reaching over 9.3 million. 
subscribers. The Company’s customers include 
domestic users, small and medium enterprises 
(SMEs), retail customers, multinationals and 
large enterprises, public sector institutions, 
other operators, and wholesale customers. 
These customers are serviced via a fibre optic 
network of nearly 65,000 km across the country, 
with broadband speeds of up to 1 Gbps whereas 
majority are served speeds of up to 200Mbps.
The Company’s over 300,000 Asymmetric 
Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) customers 
and over 500,000 fibre to the home (FTTH) 
customers, as well as over 300,000 L TE 
connections, and approximately 1,900 internet 
leased lines, are all connected through SL T’s 
network, which includes 1.2 million fibre ports 
across the island. SL T has approximately  
430 local exchange areas (LEAs) and 377  
optical terminals to connect customers

extended its access network mainly through 
fibre solutions, to meet customer connectivity 
requirements at locations such as offices and 
branches over Internet Protocol Virtual Private 
Network (IP-VPN).
SL T has expanded its fibre footprint through 
FTTH technology, offering customers a 
high-quality experience vis-à-vis broadband 
connectivity. Its 4G network/L TE network 
access with media - including L TE/wireless,

telecommunication main backbone network 
provides connectivity to global opportunities 
and is critical to the digitalisation and 
development of Sri Lanka in a digital era. Built 
on 100G technology, 500 nodes, and 75 SLBN 
nodes, the network functions continuously 
with comprehensive security features including 
Automatically Switched Optical Network 
(ASON) and a comprehensive 1+2 redundancy 
system. A key feature of the high-quality

cable system that will run from Singapore to 
France, with a design capacity of 10x13 Tbps, of 
which SL T’s invested capacity is 6 Tbps, with the 
completion date set for within 2025. This cable 
network is considered a vital component of  
Sri Lanka’s 5G network, offering customers 
access to rich content hosted in other 
countries, with high-speed connectivity to  
those locations. The investment in the 
SEA-ME-WE 6 cable has moved Sri Lanka’s

Sri Lanka T elecom PLC  
Annual Report 2022
Group Chairman’s Message
Dear Shareholders,
In a year fraught with unprecedented 
macroeconomic and industry challenges, 
Sri Lanka Telecom (SL T) Group posted 
impressive overall growth with annual revenue 
surpassing LKR 100 Bn. in the financial year 
2022. The results are reflective of the Group’s 
transformational journey that commenced in 
2020 with a clear focus on operational efficiency 
through a consolidated business structure, 
optimisation of facilities, and cost efficiencies 
and unified brand Marketing.
Launchpad for Growth
Our pace of business growth accelerated to 
double digit percentage Y oY for the two years 
2021-2022, compared to the 3-4% growth 
recorded previously. I am humbled and proud 
of this progress achieved through the hard 
work and dedication of the SL T -MOBITEL team 
backed by the Group’s strategic focus. Our 
greatest strength has always been the quality 
of our people. They are dedicated. They are 
resilient. And they are committed to delivering 
for our customers. We continued to enhance 
our employee value proposition to attract 
and retain top talent, provided a satisfactory 
year-end bonus and prioritised the health 
and well-being of our staff and their families 
during the year under review. Moreover , we 
strengthened our brand and the business, 
based on the inclusive management principle 
of working closely and working unitedly with 
trust between the management and the staff. 
Furthermore, based on our core principles and 
our governance code, we continued to conduct 
our operations with zero tolerance to any form 
of corruption. 
Some of our operations were unified in 2022, 
especially in areas where there was duplication 
of work by subsidiary entities. The groundwork 
laid out in 2022 is now in the launch phase which 
would generate substantial cost savings in 
the future. In the initial phase, the operational 
offices and Teleshops in some areas were 
brought under one roof, serving as an example 
of success in unified operations. We are now 
ready to expand this programme to major cities.
The construction of our nine-storey 
SL T -MOBITEL headquarters building in  
Welikada phase 1 was completed within one 
year , and was made ready for occupancy. Mobitel 
operational offices are scheduled to move into 
the new building, enabling the company to save 
an estimated LKR 300-400 Mn. per annum 
on rent. It is noteworthy to mention that if we 
hadn’t taken this initiative forward, Mobitel would 
have spent LKR 3.5 Bn. on rent for relevant 
premises including Rotunda T ower occupation 
for ten years, starting from 2019. The Welikada 
operational headquarters constructed at a cost 
of approximately LKR 2.5 Bn. is one of the most 
modern, green buildings in Sri Lanka, powered 
by renewable energy and water saving through 
rainwater harvesting.
Connecting Sri Lanka to the globe, the  
SEA-ME-WE 6 cable project is now on course 
for execution, with the involvement of a US 
company, SubCom. The funds required for this 
project, in the range of USD 40-50 Mn. were 
allocated and placed in a separate account 
for disbursement. We have also negotiated 
with SubCom to source the latest 
telecommunication technology knowledge 
through our T raining Centre in Welisara.
The development, expansion, and 
enhancement of the T raining Centre in Welisara 
also commenced in 2022, to upgrade the centre 
to an Institution of Technology and obtain 
“University” status from the University Grants 
Commission (UGC). Upon completion, we 
expect the number of students to increase to 
an average of 2,000 per annum, and to engage 
our staff and the youth of Sri Lanka in high-end 
IT education.
The year 2022 ended on a positive note with 
the SL T recording a steady profit, compared 
to its competitors. Whilst our operating profits 
are commendable, the increase in corporate 
tax rates eroded the net profits during the 
year under review. However , the prudent 
management of finances resulted in a 
substantial exchange gain for SL T enabling  
the Company to record an impressive bottom 
line. Moreover , in 2022, we reduced our 
long-term borrowings by 23.3%, from LKR 
61.68 Bn. in 2019 to LKR 47.29 Bn. which is a 
noteworthy achievement. Our Copper Recycling 
Project progressed well generating substantial 
income, and we plan to expand the project in 
2023. In recognition of our discipline, and well-
planned disposition towards the Nation and 
its people, we were named among the top 10 
corporates in Sri Lanka recently.
Expanding our Horizon
Strengthened by our achievements in 2022, 
we look forward to a cautious but exciting year 
ahead. In the current macroeconomic and 
geopolitical conditions, we will make every  
effort to strictly control our CAPEX budget, 
whilst seeking other avenues of revenue to 
boost both the top and the bottom line of the 
Company. From a broader perspective, this has 
been a turnaround year for us toward reaching 
higher goals.
One of our main focus areas for 2023 will be the 
unification of operations, commencing from 
Sales and Marketing, to Network Management. 
We will cautiously transfer our 3G network 
to 4G and achieve operational cost savings. 
Furthermore, we will diligently enhance the 
growth strategies of our subsidiaries, to ensure 
they operate profitably, making a significant 
contribution to the cumulative bottom line.
Our efforts such as in-house planning,  
taking stock of customer premises  
equipment (CPE), and conducting a collection 
campaign of non-utilised instruments for  
re-use would enable us to launch a concerted 
effort to use the 1.2 million ports in our fibre 
network, optimally.
Our Annual Business Plan (ABP 2023) 
presented recently was one of the finest in my 
commercial career , through which I realised the 
strong resolve of our highly experienced and 
knowledgeable engineers and technicians to 
achieve higher targets beyond organic growth. 
We have broken out from tradition and reached 
out to new business verticals, especially in 
devices, processes, and home-grown platforms.
SL T Global is also in operation, with the recent 
initiatives to engage a UAE-based entity to 
deploy a team of our technical staff for a 
telecommunication project. We hope to expand 
this business in 2023 to reach much larger 
projects and to offer secondments to a larger 
number of skilled staff members.

Cost Reduction Strategies
One of the biggest challenges we faced was  
the cost of equipment due to forex disparities. 
We have addressed this by developing 
equipment locally, and our R&D centre ‘The 
Embryo’ working closely with relevant agencies 
to introduce new products. R&D will be 
further enhanced with the induction of young, 
differently-thinking youth into our Organisation.
We will prioritise the cost reduction of the 
annual maintenance contracts (AMCs) and 
energy using AMC platforms developed  
in-house, and utilise solar power to reduce the 
draw from the national grid.
The service cost of our network has been 
addressed through the new initiative - “Zero 
Faults”, where network management is 
empowered via technology to reduce service 
faults. Similarly, with the expansion of fibre 
usage, a gradual transformation will take place 
to reduce Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSANs), 
and thereby curtail operational costs.
We plan to deploy this work plan for the greater 
benefit of our stakeholders and staff members. 
Given the current economic milieu where 
taxes and interest rates further burden our 
organisation and our staff members, we aim to 
implement measures in consultation with our 
HR to reduce the burden on our workforce.
Navigating through the volatile market 
conditions has placed the group in a strong 
position to deliver sustainable performance. 
T ransformation is critical to evolve and  
navigate challenging market conditions,  
secure business sustainability, and enable a 
future-ready workforce. We remain firm in  
our resolve to provide state-of-the-art 
solutions to our customers across all segments, 
facilitate socioeconomic progress, and support 
Sri Lanka’s transformation into a smart nation.

Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
Dear Stakeholders,
Reflections on 2022
In a year marked by unprecedented challenges 
following the economic crisis and the 
lingering effects of the global pandemic, 
Sri Lanka Telecom group (SL T) recorded a 
commendable performance delivering value to 
its stakeholders. Our success would not have 
been possible without the continued dedication 
and unparalleled support of the exceptional 
SL T team. I wish to thank each and every one of 
them for their efforts during the year and their 
unwavering support for our customers.
Following the brand unification in 2021 that 
positioned the SL T Group as the National ICT 
solutions provider , a key focus for 2022 was 
the unification of the group structure and 
consolidation of operations under one roof to 
harness greater synergies and cost efficiencies. 
In the context of the prevailing economic 
crisis in the country, one of the most crucial 
challenges faced by telecom operators in  
Sri Lanka is that our telecom tariffs are  
amongst the lowest in the world and in the 
region. SL T has always been consumer-minded 
in pricing, and at the same time, the Company 
makes significant investments in infrastructure 
annually to remain on par with global telco and 
IT industry trends. This enables the telecom 
industry to continue offering a high standard 
of service and state-of-the-art solutions to 
customers. We have remained committed to 
driving growth devoid of corruption and waste, 
enhancing productivity, and improving our 
efficiencies to provide an unmatched value 
proposition to customers.
Company Strategy and Vision
Adopting a decentralised decision-making 
process within the organisation, we empowered 
the right people with the relevant expertise 
to make the right decisions. We focused 
extensively on the well-being of our staff, 
making strategic decisions to achieve a 
balance between ensuring safety and service 
delivery. Moreover , amid the prevalent credit 
crunch and rising interest rates, we sought 
alternative sources of funding, with a focus on 
cash flow management, and restructured our 
debts. Furthermore, we fortified our immobile 
assets to strengthen the balance sheet and 
improved our debt-equity ratio whilst gradually 
strengthening the cash flows. We optimised 
asset utilisation and resource allocation to 
achieve internal efficiencies, progressed on  
our digitisation agenda, and become a more 
agile organisation. 
The Value Proposition to 
Employees
Being one of the first organisations in Sri Lanka 
to initiate the work-from-home concept during 
the pandemic on a large scale, we continued 
to implement efficient work strategies for 
our employees. This included a POD-based 
working model allowing our regional telecom 
officers to work collaboratively from multiple 
locations close to their area of residence. While 
continuing that practice, we are introducing 
apps to identify the time clocked and the 
quality of work to achieve the desired level of 
efficiency. Some of the key highlights for 2022 
were establishing a new staff recruitment 
process and promotion schemes on par with 
industry standards, and introducing an inclusive 
management concept to nurture a harmonious 
environment amongst the management, 
employees, and trade unions. We also 
established the smart technician programme 
and smart sales officer programmes, while the 
SL TM T raining Centre (SL TTC) became the first 
Sri Lankan educational institution to attain NVQ 
Level 6 equivalent status through an agreement 
with the Tertiary and Vocational Education 
Commission (TVEC).
A Resilient Performance
Overcoming the external impacts, SL T recorded 
a resilient performance in 2022 and was the 
only Telecom company in Sri Lanka to record a 
profit in 2022. The resilience in our performance 
is primarily due to management intervention 
in containing costs, the reduction in energy 
costs, consolidation of operations moving 
into company-owned premises, and asset 
monetisation subject to government policy 
being stable to attract FDIs. As a result, the total 
revenue of the SL T Group increased by 5.23% 
Y oY to LKR 107.7 Bn. in 2022 mainly drive by a 
12.97% increase in fixed telephony operations. 
Group profit after tax witnessed a decline 
of -60.82% Y oY compared to LKR 12.16 Bn. 
recorded in the previous financial year . 
Borrowings increased marginally by 1.50% 
Y oY to LKR 47.29 Bn. in 2022, whilst equity 
declined marginally by 1.58% Y oY to LKR 
92.49 Bn. As a result, the debt-to-equity ratio 
amounted to 78.0% in 2022 compared to 
66.1% in 2021. Operating cashflows amounted 
to LKR 38.35 Bn. We invested LKR 43.32 Bn. 
in new technologies to enhance our revenue 
generation capabilities in 2022.
Cash and cash equivalents as of 31 December 
2022 amounted to LKR 14.15 Bn. The market 
capitalisation of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC 
increased by 75.28% to LKR 122.73 Bn. during 
the reporting period.
Our ESG Progress
We continue to make meaningful progress in 
our Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
commitments, revolving around three main 
pillars – Nature, Education, and Healthcare, and 
a supplementary pillar; Sponsorship. Focused 
on energy management, waste management, 
and ecosystem preservation, we continued to 
progress on our environmental sustainability 
initiatives. During the year under review, an 
ESG strategic committee was established and 
we launched the National “Mee”  T ree Planting 
Programme under our flagship “Sabandiyawe 
Sathakaraya”  ESG programme. We also uplifted 
the communities by improving infrastructure 
of underprivileged schools and expanding ICT 
learning opportunities across Sri Lanka.
Furthermore, we conducted a series of  
online awareness programmes on 
environmental preservation, encouraging 
the public to protect and conserve nature. 
We also conducted cultivation programmes 
in 8 provinces across Sri Lanka, recovered 
and recycled 79,480 kilograms of copper , and 
reduced CEB/LECO total energy consumption 
(except generator power) by 1.8% Y oY in FY 
2022 to 77,545,248 kWh.

A Look to the Future
We are well positioned in our industry 
through a unique set of assets that help us 
deliver for customers and create value for 
our stakeholders. The growing shift to digital 
platforms, particularly in the post-pandemic 
era, continues to drive SL T’s plans for the 
future, whilst we focus on consolidating our 
new identity following the unification of our 
organisation structure from January 2023. 
T urning challenges into opportunities we will 
lead from the front reducing the digital divide in 
the country and leading Sri Lanka towards digital 
inclusion whilst preserving good governance 
and protecting the environment. 
A Word of Appreciation
In closing, I convey my sincere appreciation  
to my team SL T CEO, Mobitel CEO and 
the CEOs of all other subsidiaries for their 
exemplary efforts, commitment, and endurance 
in challenging circumstances as they delivered 
a seamless service to our customers and 
communities that we serve. I am grateful to  
the Board for their counsel and invaluable 
guidance in navigating the unprecedented 
challenges. I thank the Telecommunications 
Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka for 
its collaborative and proactive approach to 
regulatory matters. My gratitude is extended to 
the customers and business partners for their 
continued loyalty and support.

Sri Lanka T elecom PLC  
Annual Report 2022
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Dear Stakeholders,
The aftermath of the pandemic brought its 
own set of challenges, particularly given the 
current economic environment, amid rapid 
inflation, and foreign currency shortages. 
We navigated the challenges by enhancing 
efficiencies, managing costs, and seeking and 
capitalising on new opportunities following the 
heightened customer demand for broadband 
and connectivity, and digital Apps/tools.
Strategic Focus
We have achieved a consistent growth over the 
past two years, driven by a focus on maintaining 
our leadership position, especially with the 
nation’s shift towards realising a digital economy. 
T o enable a smart nation, we have focused on 
building the necessary infrastructure with a fibre 
network of 65,000 kilometres across the island, 
the unification of operations in delivering of 
fixed and mobile services, and offering a unified 
SL T -MOBITEL Group brand proposition. This 
was supported by a focus on agile organisational 
processes and an innovative culture. We also 
strengthened our R&D unit Embryo in 2022, 
while building partnerships to offer new services 
to customers via digital platforms utilising 
cutting-edge technologies such as Machine 
Learning/ Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics, 
Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Metaverse 
and many other emerging technologies. 
Overcoming Challenges
In response to the concerns of stakeholders 
amid the challenging operating milieu, we 
offered additional support to navigate the crisis, 
by implementing hybrid work arrangements 
for employees, launching programmes 
for customer premises equipment (CPE) 
recovery and refurbishment in the face of 
resource shortages, implementing cost 
reduction initiatives by absorbing the Annual 
Maintenance Contract scope to be done by 
our own engineering and technical staff where 
possible, and providing digital channels to 
enhance customer experience management. 
Managing staff turnover was another key 
challenge, amid a growing trend of skilled 
migration observed across the corporate sector . 
T o increase employee retention, we extended 
valuable internal growth opportunities, skills 
development, leadership programmes, and 
fringe benefits to elevate staff morale.
Key Markets
Broadband penetration has become key in  
the consumer and retail segment, especially 
given the increased demand for online and 
virtual platforms catering to everything from 
business to education to entertainment. This 
has created a vast opportunity for telcos to 
provide broadband services to this market 
segment. Our cost effective solutions including 
digital and cloud-based platforms have catered 
to the SME segment, while also providing  
end-to-end managed services and cloud 
solutions to enterprise and government 
customers. SL T’s domestic wholesale  
segment that includes all licensed operators in 
Sri Lanka is served with reliable high speed fibre 
connectivity, co-location and Cloud Services. 
Meanwhile, our international wholesale business 
encompasses a large number of bilateral 
partnerships with Global telcos primarily in 
relation to the provision of global voice and data 
services under Xyntac. Systems integration 
Business and Digital Business Services are also 
key focused business areas,
Journey of Digital 
T ransformation
SL T is transforming from a telco to a techco, 
a technology company, by evolving from a 
communication services provider to a digital 
services provider . This entailed offering new 
services, the virtualisation of our networks, 
and the process of cloudification. We aim to 
expand our digital infrastructure, including the 
fibre and 4G L TE networks, along with data 
centres and the multi-cloud environment, which 
are crucial to enabling and delivering digital 
services. Furthermore, we invested in capacity 
augmentation of global internet and submarine 
cable capacity which is a key component of 
our digital transformation journey. We are 
considering collaborating and supporting 
the digital initiatives of our customers, by 
strengthening our in-house capabilities and 
by establishing a broader local and global 
digital service partner eco system. Further , we 
develop solutions based on IOT and analytics 
for many industry verticals in order to transform 
traditional processes into smart operations.
Operational Synergies
By consolidating our fixed and mobile business 
through the unified SL T -MOBITEL brand, we 
have harnessed synergies and efficiencies at 
the operational level. The provision of both fixed 
and mobile communication services through 
the MySL T self-care app. along with Unified 
customer touchpoints, marketing material, 
and digital channels, support our fixed and 
mobile business convergence efforts. Sales 
and operations under the SL T -MOBITEL brand 
now pose a single unified front, offering total 
fixed and mobile solutions to customers in 
the enterprise and SME markets. In the retail 
segment, we anticipate the expansion of 
mAgent concept to encompass the unified 
entity in 2023. We believe that having a single 
network group would lead to synergies and cost 
savings, and facilitate the sharing of platforms 
and the consolidation of systems to deliver an 
enhanced user experience. 
Key Investments
T o provide best-in-class coverage, speed, 
security, reliability, and performance to 
customers in 2022, we made substantial 
investments towards expanding our accelerated 
fibre programme even amid an escalation in 
costs in the latter part of the year . Additionally, 
investments were made to fortify the internet, 
the data centre, and cloud-related projects. 
Key investments planned for 2023 include our 
FTTH project, as well as expansion of the 4G 
L TE network, and channelling funds towards 5G 
when the 5G spectrum is available. Furthermore, 
we have started to invest in the SEA-ME-WE 
6 submarine cable system as a consortium 
partner , whilst constructing a cable landing 
station in Matara, with the planned project 
completion to be in Q2 of 2025.

A Noteworthy Performance
We recorded a robust performance for 2022, 
with a Y oY growth in revenue of LKR 67,569 Mn. 
and a 12% growth in earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 
of LKR 24,056 Mn. Profit after tax recorded a 
growth of 44% to LKR 8.5 Bn. in 2022. Moreover , 
a forex gain of LKR 5,152 Mn. was recorded  
in the year under review. The cumulative 
revenue growth over the two-year period, 
covering 2021 and 2022 exceeded a 
phenomenal LKR 16 Bn. The performance for 
the year was driven by higher broadband and 
fibre penetration, especially through FTTH 
services. We benefited from a considerable 
expansion of the domestic wholesale segment, 
in addition to the growth in the consumer , 
enterprise, government, SME, and international 
business segments. We also maintained 
financial resilience, with equity increasing by  
6% Y oY due to healthy profitability. In 2022,  
the company's debts increased by 18% in order 
to support the investments in critical projects 
such as the islandwide fibrerisation project, that 
resulted in a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.85.  
Investing in our People
We are acutely aware of the importance 
of boosting staff morale and increasing 
productivity. Therefore, several initiatives 
were implemented to increase employee 
motivation and retention in 2022. In response 
to the challenges faced by employees owing 
to prevailing macroeconomic conditions, we 
enabled remote working opportunities for staff 
to work from home and moved to hybrid working 
models that offered greater flexibility. T ransport 
facilities were provided to staff members at the 
height of the fuel crisis. Our training centres 
continued to identify skill gaps and upskill staff, 
for them to be in par with the latest industry 
and technology trends, as we move into a new 
digital era. Our employees benefit from local and 
foreign training opportunities. Moreover ,  
we encourage staff members to engage in 
sports and welfare activities, to have a holistic 
work experience, and maintain a healthy  
work-life balance. The unification of the 
organisational structure under the umbrella of 
SL T -MOBITEL engenders ever-greater agility 
and flexibility in terms of human resources 
management, with a unified value system for 
the HR division. I am happy to state that all the 
trade unions have been highly supportive of the 
inclusive management initiatives undertaken 
during the year .
The Journey Ahead
Increasing capacity, offering improved speed, 
and reliable and secure connectivity to 
enterprises and consumers are of paramount 
importance as we move forward. Therefore, 
our key focus area, particularly in the domestic 
market, is to cater to the growing demand from 
customers for high-speed broadband, for which 
we have already introduced download speeds 
of 200Mbps. The fibre rollout would be another 
focal point to expand coverage through the 
high speed fibre network, alongside the 4G L TE 
wireless network. Future opportunities would 
include providing more broadband capacity, 
especially given the proliferation of bandwidth- 
intensive applications and the ensuing demand 
for high-speed broadband. As a result, we will 
focus on expanding our fibre network, Data 
Centres and multi-cloud platforms. Given the 
national focus on a digital economy, towards 
introducing new digital platforms to trim 
costs, prevent revenue leakages, and improve 
operational efficiencies, digital transformation 
initiatives would remain a high priority on our 
agenda. SL T -MOBITEL Enterprise will focus on 
providing customised solutions to Enterprise, 
SME and Government sector customers with 
cutting-edge technologies such as SD–WAN, 
AI, IOT , RPA, multi-cloud, and in the very near 
future 5G.
Xyntac, the global unit of Sri Lanka Telecom, 
being a part of global supply chain concentrates 
on expanding the carrier-grade connectivity and 
innovative digital services to our customer base 
in the international market. SL T -MOBITEL has 
invested in the 126Tbps SEA-ME-WE 6 cable 
system which expands from France to Singapore 
and is expected to commission in Q2 of 2025. 
Further Xyntac is focusing on the expansions 
of its commercial and physical presence in 
more global regions by establishing new Points 
of Presence(PoPs) with a fully redundant 
architecture. Xyntac’ s ISP Service is improving 
its position by being within the first 50 Global 
Internet Service Providers. By reaching more 
global eyeballs it has become the first Sri Lankan 
Telco to be listed amongst the global ISP giants. 
In an effort to expand into international 
enterprise markets, we have established a 
new Strategic Business Unit (SBU) for Global 
Business. Within a short period, we have 
achieved a lot of promising results. In the years 
to come, I believe that the SL T Global SBU will be 
a formidable regional force.
Thank Y ou
Our people are the driving force behind  
SL T -MOBITEL ’s success. 2022 was a challenging 
year , throughout which the professionalism, 
dedication, and expertise of our people 
were always to the fore, even in the most 
testing circumstances. I am very grateful to 
them for their hard work and commitment 
to our customers. I express my gratitude to 
the Chairman and the Board of Directors 
for the guidance and valuable counsel 
extended to ensure the sustainable growth 
of the Company. I am grateful to our business 
partners, government agencies, and the 
Telecommunications Regulatory Commission 
of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) for their continued support 
and goodwill. I appreciate the loyalty and trust of 
our customers and shareholders.
I am proud of the progress we have made in  
the past year and the tangible momentum for 
the future.

Global Perspective
The lingering impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic and uncertainty in the global 
economy resulted in a ripple effect within the 
global telecommunications sector . This was 
noted through the impact of inflation and 
rising energy costs globally. Moreover , the 
Russia-Ukraine conflict has contributed to 
global instability, along with other factors such 
as increased inflation in numerous countries, 
leading to the implementation of financial 
restrictions and supply chain disruptions, which 
have resulted in content and streaming services 
being reduced, increased broadband package 
rates and social tariffs being included.
Among the largest disruptors in 2022  
was global inflation, which was projected to  
rise to 8.8% (from 4.7% in 2021) during the  
year , and is expected to have reached its  
highest level in nearly three decades during 
the second half of the year . The cost of living, 
energy and food crises have decelerated 
economic advancement, and led to a lag in 
technological growth.
Russia-Ukraine conflict
The conflict in Ukraine resulted in the 
displacement of millions of civilians and 
significant damages to physical capital. Deep 
cuts in oil and gas exports to Europe has been 
another outcome of this conflict, which in turn 
had adverse impacts on economic activity in the 
continent in the form of higher energy prices, 
weaker consumer confidence, and disruptions 
to the manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, 
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries 
observed that these changes in the energy 
markets resulting from the Russia-Ukraine 
war could benefit the region, and improve 
consumer confidence and investments for the 
hydrocarbon exporters in the region.
Economic Growth
Global growth is expected to slow from 6.0% 
in 2021 to 3.4% in 2022 and 2.9% in 20231. 
In particular , economic growth in developing 
countries was forecast to decelerate from 
2.7% in 2022, to 1.2% in 2023. Emerging and 
developing Asia is expected to rise in 2023 and 
2024 to 5.3% and 5.2%, respectively, following 
the deeper-than-expected slowdown in 2022 to 
4.3% attributable to China’s economy.
Operating Environment
High inflation has led to economic stagnation 
among many emerging markets and developing 
economies (EMDEs), resulting in increases in 
policy interest rates and an urgent need for 
these small states to shift expenditures from 
inefficient and expensive technologies, towards 
more environmentally friendly and cost saving 
solutions.
Supply chain risks remain a major concern in the 
manufacturing industry, as tensions arising from 
unresolved geopolitical conflicts appear to be 
expanding globally.
Energy security has also become a leading 
priority globally, with a large number of oil 
importers capitalising on higher oil and gas 
prices, and assisting with the transition towards 
a pathway of sustainability within companies.
Global T elecommunications 
Advancements
Connectivity is a cornerstone of national 
resilience, and this can be seen within  
sectors such as education, healthcare, and 
emergency services. Universal broadband 
accessibility has escalated rapidly among 
telecommunication companies, in a global 
context. Telecommunication companies have 
focused on expanding direct connectivity 
lines and broadband solutions to rural areas. 
Extending broadband networks whilst also 
facilitating cloud-led platform providers and 
maintaining operational efficiency, conducting 
regulatory compliance checks and enabling 
strategic differentiation have been some of 
the priorities in the global telecommunications 
sector .
With the contribution of data centres to global 
emissions being projected to increase to 
3.5% by 2026, and exceed 10% by 2040, the 
telecommunications sector acknowledges the 
sizeable impact of its electricity consumption 
on the environment. Given this, there is a 
sense of urgency in working towards improved 
energy efficiency solutions. This has resulted 
in telecommunication companies worldwide 
adopting alternative sustainable approaches in 
their decision making processes and operations. 
Selecting solutions that reduce environmental 
harm has taken precedence, with regional 
policymakers and regulators being more 
proactive in the pursuit and implementation of 
sustainable opportunities and regulations.

The growing demands of the 
telecommunications sector were met with the 
country being hit by a severe economic crisis 
and a number of restrictions being implemented 
on imports. Signs of economic weakness were 
observed during the pre-pandemic period 
as well, but trade restrictions enacted by 
other countries along with weak investments, 
loose monetary policies and regulations, 
resulted in further weakening of Sri Lanka’s 
economic development. Having lost access to 
international financial markets in 2020 due to 
the downgrade of its credit rating, the looming 
external debt had to be serviced by the country 
through official reserves and loans from the 
banking sector , to make payments for imports. 
A severe imbalance resulted in a debt crisis as

The Sri Lankan economy contracted by 7.8% 
during 2022. High inflation, dollar deficits, 
increased interest rates, fuel shortages, 
electricity interruptions over extremely long 
periods and fertiliser shortages plagued the 
country throughout the year . Moreover , the 
slow debt restructuring process, limited external 
financial support, import bans, and a substantial 
number of locals migrating in order to seek 
better opportunities, have negatively impacted 
the economic development of Sri Lanka.

T elecommunications Sector 
in Sri Lanka
The telecommunications sector is essential to 
the country’s development and advancement, 
and is regulated by the Telecommunications 
Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL). 
Collectively, the ICT sector generated around 
USD 1 Bn. in net inflows in 2021. Sri Lanka’s 
telecommunication sector contributes 
both directly and indirectly to the country’s 
employment, productivity, investment, 
innovation, and economic growth.
Sri Lanka is also involved in submarine cable 
system projects where SL T involved with  
SEA-ME-WE 4, and SEA-ME-WE 5, which 
connect South East Asia to Europe. The  
SEA-ME-WE 4 fibre optic cables have a 
bandwidth capacity of 4.26 Tbps., and the 
SEA-ME-WE 5 has a higher capacity of 24 
Tbps. These cables will give Sri Lanka a regional 
competitive advantage, as a business hub. 
Further , the SEA-ME-WE 6 is estimated to 
provide an additional 12 Tbps of capacity.
There is significant competition among 
three fixed-line operators, four mobile phone 
operators, and 11 Internet service providers2. 
Mobile connection penetration stood at 134% 
at the end of 2022, while fixed line penetration 
stood at 12%3. The 65,000 km SL T fibre network 
being built in Sri Lanka is expected to serve 
as the backbone for 5G development and 
enhancement of mobile and fixed broadband 
services across the country.

Sri Lanka faced severe economic hardships 
during the year 2022 stemming from  
numerous internal and external factors  
including the outbreak of the COVID-19 
pandemic. This led to many negative 
economic consequences, including the drastic 
depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR) 
against the US Dollar and rising inflation, which 
led to low purchasing power among citizens. 
Furthermore, regular interruptions to the 
power supply disrupted the operations of many 
organisations during the year . 
Despite these challenges, the SL T Group 
recorded a revenue growth of 5.2% Y oY to  
LKR 107.7 Bn. and a profit after tax of 
LKR 4.8 Bn. for the year ended 31 December 
2022. Revenue growth was mainly driven by  
the uninterrupted usage of broadband and data 
services, with many organisations continuing 
to provide work from home facilities for their 
employees, and the extension of online learning 
for students by educational institutions. The 
financial position of the Group strengthened 
during the year , with total assets recording a 
growth of 9.4% Y oY to LKR 240.6 Bn. All these 
factors have increased the resilience of the SL T 
Group to withstand the economic crisis. This 
segment sets out how we nurtured our Financial 
Capital in 2022. 
Income Statement
Revenue
Group revenue increased by 5.2% Y oY to  
LKR 107.7 Bn. in 2022, primarily due to the 
surge in broadband and data usage during 
the year , resulting from the work from home 
and online learning facilities, and increased 
use of digital infrastructure by corporate and 
government business segments. Consumer 
migration to digital platforms for transactions, 
digital learning, and entertainment continued 
to gather momentum in 2022 as well. PEO TV 
too recorded healthy growth, underpinned by 
increased usage and new connections. T ariff 
increase also contributed to revenue growth, 
effective from September 2022. 
The Group experienced increased usage across 
all customer segments, ranging from individuals 
to corporates, and government segments. 
However , fixed voice revenue declined during 
2022. Increased coverage through the Group’s 
accelerated fibre expansion programme, and 
the expansion of the 4G L TE network were the 
major contributory factors to revenue growth. 
It is noteworthy that revenue increase was 
achieved despite offering attractive pricing for 
certain packages, taking into consideration the 
need to ensure affordability for learning and 
working from home. Revenue from the Carrier 
Domestic business grew significantly during the 
year , while revenue from data products provided 
to Corporate and Government business 
segments also grew notably Y oY .

External revenue from fixed telephony  
increased by 12.8% Y oY to LKR 61.7 Bn.  
in 2022, accounting for 57.3% of Group  
revenue. Mobile revenue decreased by 4.6% to 
LKR 43.5 Bn., accounting for 40.4% of group 
revenue. The decline in mobile revenue was 
mainly due to a decrease in the subscriber 
base, resulting from an increased subscriber 
churn from March 2022, a reduction of 
interconnection charges from April 2022, device 
and sim shortage due to import restrictions, and 
frequent power cuts. 
Earnings Before Interest, T axes, 
Depreciation and Amortisation 
(EBITDA)
Group operating expenses (excluding 
depreciation and amortisation) increased by 
9.4% Y oY whilst revenue rose at a lower rate 
of 5.2%, resulting in a marginal drop in EBITDA 
by 1.0% in 2022, compared to 2021. The 
SL T Group implemented several initiatives to 
manage cost hikes including waste to cash and 
creating synergies through brand unification. 
EBITDA margin of the SL T Group decreased 
from 40.2% in 2021, to 37.8% in 2022, due 
to the increase in operational expenditure as 
a result of the heavy devaluation of the LKR 
and the inflation that exceeded 70%. The 
Company is expected to achieve the desired 
EBITDA margin by managing increased costs 
with upward revisions in tariff structures and 
improved operational efficiencies. 
Fixed operations of the Group recorded  
an EBITDA of LKR 24.1 Bn. reflecting an 
increase of 12.2% Y oY . EBITDA margin  
dropped marginally from 35.9% in 2021 to 
35.6% in 2022, driven by the increase in 
operating expenditure. EBITDA of mobile 
operations decreased by 13.3% to  
LKR 16.9 Bn. causing the EBITDA margin 
to reduce to 37.4% in 2022, from 41.3% 
in 2021. This was due to increased utility 
charges resulting from power cuts and fuel 
shortages in the country during the year , and 
the depreciation of the Rupee that increased 
expenses including annual maintenance  
costs and license costs, and repair and 
maintenance costs.

Managing Costs
The unexpected economic crisis caused  
high inflation, a shortage of fuel leading to 
continuous power cuts, an increase in fuel 
prices and tariffs, and an increase in electricity 
charges. These factors had a negative impact 
on SL T Group’s operating costs, which 
increased to LKR 95.2 Bn. in 2022, from  
LKR 88.5 Bn. in 2021. During the year , direct  
costs increased by 10.4%, primarily stemming 
from the increase in USD denominated 
payments, such as international Settlement 
charges and ITL. The overall cost increase 
of 7.6%, which significantly exceeded 
revenue growth of 5.2%, caused operating 
profit to decline by 9.6%, and the operating 
profit margin to decline to 11.6% in 2022, 
compared to 13.5% in 2021.

Profit Before and After T ax
Profit before tax (PBT) decreased by  
17.4% to LKR 10.6 Bn. in 2022, due to the 
higher increase in operating expenses of 
7.6% compared to the revenue growth of 
5.2%, the increased interest expense, and 
foreign exchange loss. Furthermore, taxation 
increased by 786.3% during the year , due 
to the hike in tax rates during 2022, which 
impacted the overall tax, including deferred 
tax. Accordingly, Profit after tax (PA T) 
decreased by 60.8% to LKR 4.8 Bn. 
The Group’s fixed operations recorded its 
highest profits ever in 2022, amounting to 
LKR 8.5 Bn. resulting from an exchange gain 
of LKR 5.2 Bn. The Group’s mobile operations 
recorded a decline of 101.5%, mainly due to 
the LKR depreciation in the currency market, 
which led to a foreign exchange loss of  
LKR 5.4 Bn. Furthermore, the Group’s  
PEOTV operations (VisionCom) recorded 
a loss of LKR 1.8 Bn., in 2022, driven by the 
devaluation of the Sri Lankan Rupee, a foreign 
exchange loss of LKR 1.5 Bn. was recorded

The Group maintained its liquidity position 
with short-term investments and cash and 
cash equivalents amounting to LKR 18.1 Bn. 
reflecting a decline of 31.0% compared to

Cashflows
The net cash flows generated from 
operations decreased by 33.3% to  
LKR 28.9 Bn. An increase in receivables and 
prepayments led to a decrease in the net 
cash flow generated from operations in  
2022 compared to 2021. The cash outflow  
on capital expenditure increased to  
LKR 40.8 Bn. in 2022 compared to  
LKR 30.0 Bn. in 2021 due to the need 
to invest in new technologies, improve 
speed, and enhance capacity to support 
the Nation’s increased dependency on

in every aspect of life. Net cash used in 
financing activities recorded an inflow of  
LKR 0.7 Bn. comprising an increase in vendor 
financing of LKR 13.2 Bn. (inflow) offsetting 
the repayment of borrowings of LKR 7.6 Bn.,

SL T’s manufactured capital includes databases, 
data lake, data warehouse, and machine learning 
models. It also includes cables, ports, fibre 
connection lines, wireless network systems, and 
transport network equipment of SL T and service 
delivery networks.
Recognised as the National Information  
and Communications Technology (ICT) 
solutions provider , SL T , embarked on numerous 
initiatives to improve its infrastructure. These 
were focused on SL T continuing its role as  
the largest contributor towards Sri Lanka’s 
smart initiatives to make innovative technology, 
the backbone of every sphere of activity. The 
three main initiatives adopted during 2022 are 
the implementation of the Go Global and Bring 
Go Global strategies to attract USD investment 
to boost the Nation’s foreign currency earnings, 
streamlining SL T’s network transformation to 
ensure that any form of network development 
adheres to the blueprint provided, and 
transforming the FTTH service provisioning to a 
fully automated process. 
Throughout 2022, consistent investment 
was made to expand the Company’s physical 
infrastructure, with annual investments of  
LKR 37,778 Mn. in 2022, out of which  
LKR 36,224 Mn. remained in the capital as a 
work-in-progress at the close of the year .  
This is expected as the investments undertaken 
are generally long-term by nature. At the  
start of the year , the outstanding capital  
work-in-progress was LKR 26,223 Mn., of which 
the value of operationalised assets that were 
taken out amounted to LKR 22,756 Mn. Capital 
work-in-progress at the year-end amounted to  
LKR 39,691 Bn.
Capacity enhancements 
Some of the capacity expansion projects 
include the development of 233,000 FTTH 
ports, increase the volume of rack spaces 
at the Pitipana Data Centre, expanded the 
global connectivity capacity of SEA-ME-WE 5 
submarine cable, and increase the international 
backhaul capacity; the network that connects 
all the international cables landing to Sri Lanka 
to the national network. T o cater to the 
enhanced customer demand, the capacity of 
the last-mile access network and the transport 
network was augmented during the year under 
review. The increasing internet traffic due 
to the growth in the customer base and the 
new internet applications was addressed by 
expanding the transport network and the ISP 
network capacities. Further the expansion of 
IP Multimedia system (i.e., the IMS network), 
enabled to address the requirements of the 
voice customer base. A PoP was implemented in 
Matara to link ISP globally connected network. A 
software-defined wide area network technology 
– SD-WAN, for enterprise and corporate 
customers were introduced to seamlessly use 
multiple last-mile access, to carry customer 
traffic as defined by the customer . Furthermore, 
the integration of alarms to the broadband 
network, Ethernet, the 4G L TE wireless network, 
as well as the SLBN (Sri Lanka Backbone 
Network), was consolidated achieving a single 
view, resulting in operating cost savings.
5G Network
SL T and Mobitel has stationed its own 5G 
pre-commercial trial network with the aid 
of the Telecommunications Regulatory 
Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) 5G trial 
license in Colombo, Kandy, Galle, Anuradhapura, 
and Jaffna. Customers who have a 5G capable 
device and compatible with SL T -MOBITEL 5G 
network can experience 5G technology in the 
aforementioned areas. Detail information can 
be viewed by visiting SL T -MOBITEL 5G website 
– https:/ /5g.sltmobitel.lk/5gmobitel. 
In addition, any customer can visit  
SL T -MOBITEL branch locations in 
aforementioned cities and can experience 
SL T -MOBITEL 5G network. The commercial 5G 
license is expected from TRCSL in 2023 and  
SL T -MOBITEL will convert the pre-commercial 
5G trial network into a commercial 5G network 
once 5G commercial license is received. 
Under SL T -MOBITEL 5G strategy, a common 
5G infrastructure is planned to be deployed 
for the group to optimise investments and to 
enhance synergy within the group which in turn 
support SL T -MOBITEL to offer more affordable 
broadband packages to the customer . The 
existing pre-commercial 5G network was 
already deployed based on this strategy. Further 
expansions of 5G network will be done once 5G 
commercial license is received from TRCSL.

Projects Completed  
during 2022
SL T completed several projects during the year . 
Some of the key projects are given below:
  Augmentation of SLBN
  Augmentation of IP Network capacities
  Augmentation of ISP network capacities
  CEA footprint and capacity expansions
  Development of 233,000 FTTH  
Home Pass ports
  5G pre-commercial trial network
  Global IP network capacity augmentations
  Commissioning of additional SEA-ME-WE 5 
submarine cable capacities
SL T monetised its fixed assets, by implementing 
the Waste-to-Cash project that enabled 
savings of approximately LKR 900 Mn. by 
recycling of recovered copper cables, reuse of 
customer premises equipment (CPE), through 
copper cables, poles and other equipment. 
The Company collected customer premises 
equipment (own by company) of service 
disconnected belonging to former customers, 
refurbished and reused. This was introduced 
to mitigate the adverse effects of the current 
economic crisis prevalent through 2022. In 
promoting digitalisation and supporting the 
national efforts of the Central Bank of Sri 
Lanka, SL T -MOBITEL introduced the mCash 
Village Concept initiative, empowering rural 
villages to accept cashless payments via Lanka 
QR certified merchants. The mCash concept 
has nurtured many villages across Sri Lanka 
including Badureliya, Jaffna, and Mahiyanganaya. 
Furthermore, following an in-depth study, 
measures were taken to provide a cost-effective 
home connection to clients by optimising 
the drop wire distance and the number of 
poles used. Moreover , the service fulfillment 
dashboard was developed to converge all the 
reports, management of service provisioning, 
and network operations into one single view. 
A more secure access method for all EMS’ 
(Element Management Systems) was adopted 
during the year .
Physical Infrastructure
A multi-purpose Recreation Centre was 
established in Poththode, for training and 
development of employees and contractors. 
T o facilitate a more productive lifestyle 
through advanced technologies, “The Arena”, 
a new experience center was established at 
the BMICH. This showcases the innovative 
and next-generation customer-centered 
services and solutions that pioneer the digital 
transformation initiatives of SL T . Furthermore, 
under the concept of “Shopping Shop” two 
teleshops were established, in Kandy and 
Colombo. These teleshops are found within 
smaller spaces such as supermarkets where 
there is plenty of foot traffic to reach a wider 
customer base.
The Ongoing Projects of SL T
The Company has embarked on several projects 
which are still ongoing.
Under SL T’s 5G strategy, the Company 
has stationed its own 5G pre-commercial 
trial network with the approval of 
Telecommunications Regulatory Commission 
of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) 5G trial license in Colombo, 
Kandy, Galle, Anuradhapura, and Jaffna.  
A commercial 5G license is expected from 
TRCSL in 2023, to convert it's current  
pre-commercial 5G trial network into a 
commercial network.
The construction of SL T’s new state-of  
the art operational headquarters in Welikada, 
comprise of nine floors, with phase one (up to 
the 5th floor) planned to be functional by May 
2023, and the entire building (up to the 9th floor) 
planned to be functional by the end of 2025. 
Once completed, this building will be recognised 
as the Company's first building to receive the 
green rating of “platinum” provided by the Green 
Building Council of Sri Lanka.
The master plan for the proposed development 
of the 7-acre land has been prepared and 
approved by the Urban Development Authority 
(UDA). The development of the land has 
commenced with the construction of the new 
nine-storied building, which has only utilised 
about 2% of the underutilised space of the 
land. The remaining space is reserved for future 
developments as planned in the master plan.
SL T maintains a sustainable environmental 
strategy, utilising recovered building material 
from existing buildings that were previously 
demolished, and by recycling material as a way 
of reducing wastage. Moreover , for the interior 
of the building, furniture will be reused as a way 
of minimising interior work. The building also 
contains a sewage and wastewater treatment 
plant, to conserve water usage comprising 
rainwater harvesting and water recycling 
facilities that are powered by solar energy, to be 
used for irrigation and washrooms.
T o emphasise the importance of energy 
efficiency, the lighting of the building will be 
fitted with LED lighting, an energy efficient  
air conditioning system, and solar paneling over 
the roof. An estimated 40% of energy will be 
salvaged in comparison to the energy usage of 
a conventional building. Keeping with an open 
office concept that compliments the natural 
environment, the building offers indoor  
spaces for creating an unified environment  
for employees. This new building will ensure  
new standards for employee wellness and 
leverage innovation, deploying opportunities for 
further expansions.
Galle submarine cable depot is a joint  
venture of SL T and Indian Ocean Cable  
Ship Pvt Ltd, which is a partnership between 
Singapore Telecom and France Telecom 
(Orange Marine). It stores submarine cables and 
spares for repairs and services a consortium of

demand of emerging new cable systems in 
2023/24. Further expansion is planned in 2024 
to cater to demand beyond 2024, including the 
SMW6 new system.
SEA-ME-WE 6 is an ongoing international 
submarine cable project and is a collaboration 
with cable consortium parties and suppliers. 
The planning process including under-sea 
surveys, country access studies, and landing 
stations have already commenced, and the 
equipment manufacturing currently in process. 
It is expected to be commissioned in Q4 2025. 
This venture is an operation that will be carried 
out for three years which includes the process 
of laying 22,000 km of undersea fibre cables, 
construction of land network and equipment 
installations in all participating countries, from 
Europe to Singapore.

Efficient Work Strategies
With the introduction of remote working, 
employees were enabled to Work from Home 
and Work from Pod, whilst the field staff 
were enabled the Home to Field work mode. 
Employees working in remote locations were 
facilitated to work from pods located in specific 
areas across Sri Lanka. Furthermore, employees 
were also enabled to work from SL T offices 
closest to their homes.
The “HQ Home to Field” was introduced 
facilitating employees to directly attend to 
their work requirements in the field without 
having to visit the office. This was mainly for 
SL T employees who are required to report to 
work outside of the office, such as at outside 
plant maintenance centres or for other network 
maintenance activities.
Digitalisation Solutions
Through a process of digital transformation, 
the HR division at SL T enables a fully automated 
ERP system. This ensures that all HR operations, 
terminal benefit management procedures, 
and recruitments are processed through a fully 
automated system. Holding 15,000 to 20,000 
records, the new automated system includes a 
document management system that is linked to 
the ERP system.
With a workforce of over 8,058 employees,  
the digitalisation of employee records has 
enabled a paperless environment within SL T . 
More than 90% of HR processes are automated 
and SL T is moving towards a fully automated and 
paperless environment.
SL T was recognised among  
the Best performers in the 
“ Automation Excellence –  
Sri Lanka” category by the panel 
of jurors at the UiPath Automation

A Paradigm Shift in  
Human Resource Management 
within SL T
Following dynamic business and operational 
requirements, SL T introduced the process of 
revamping its staff recruitment and promotion 
schemes in 2022 on par with industry standards.
A committee was appointed to address these 
aspects, with the task of developing new 
Staff Recruitment and Promotion Scheme 
(SRPS) and the new competencies necessary 
to meet specific job requirements within the 
Organisation. Focusing on programmes such 
as data science and artificial intelligence, SL T 
is navigating its way through technological 
advancements in telecommunications, upskilling 
its employees with relevant training.
T alent Sourcing
T alent sourcing at SL T has been restructured 
into a well-planned management strategy, 
incorporating solutions developed to attract and 
retain employees within the Company.
Interviews are carried out through a series of 
assessments that identify the most suitable 
candidates for the roles being sought on a 
permanent basis. The Company adopts online 
solutions during the recruitment process, 
which aid with the testing of specific skills of 
candidates. This new approach has enabled 
SL T to enhance its brand and status in the 
telecommunications industry of Sri Lanka. 
During the year under review, SL T recruited 460 
employees to its cadre, and 201 employees 
retired from service.

T alent Development
The essence of creating the right environment 
within the Company is to identify strengths and 
motivational factors among employees. The 
T alent Development Division at SL T seeks to 
emphasis personal skills and talents and aid 
the development of such skills to enhance the 
performance of each individual at SL T .
The Sri Lanka Telecom T alent Development 
Centres (SL TTDC) located in, Welisara, 
Moratuwa and Peradeniya provide services to 
both professionals in the field, and the public. 
Being a leading ICT service provider with a 
wealth of knowledge and experience, SL T  
strives to impart this knowledge via SL TTDC, 
which has added-value to the knowledge 
economy in Sri Lanka. A range of tertiary and 
vocational training courses are offered in 
many fields such as IT , management and data 
communication, etc. The T alent Development 
Centre also collaborates with the University of 
Hertfordshire to offer a three-year Bachelor of 
Engineering degree.
T alent Retention
With Sri Lanka facing an economic crisis, talent 
retention has proved to be a challenge. SL T’s 
generous approach to employee benefits, 
employee well-being, and placing importance 
on inculcating a motivating work environment 
have contributed to a motivated workforce. 
Yet, this has proven to be inadequate due to 
the increasing number of employees migrating 
overseas in search of better prospects.
With the significant number of highly  
skilled employees with technical capabilities 
migrating, SL T adjusted its strategies to 
accommodate and address the brain drain. In 
response, a separate path will be created for 
employees to move to higher levels within the 
Company. Providing incentives and creating 
opportunities to rise through the ranks of SL T’s 
hierarchy has proved to be useful in ensuring 
talent retention. The employee retention rate 
stood at 92.4 % in 2022.

with the participation of 1,624 Technicians. 
476 Technicians were certified as SMART

conducting reassessments. This programme 
will be continued to next year . Both the 
SMART Technician and SMART Sales Officer 
programmes were carried out islandwide.
In collaboration with the Tertiary and Vocational 
Education Commission (TVEC), National

eight-year programme and mainly target for the 
middle management positions. This programme 
is still in the development phase, and expected 
to be launched in 2023.

offering special programmes to develop 
its senior managerial staff. Currently, 11 
senior managers at SL T have completed the 
Professional Masters in Business Analytics and 
Digital T ransformation (PMBADT) programme 
conducted by the Asian Institute of Technology 
(AIT) Thailand.
Other T alent Development 
Initiatives

technicians NVQ 4 qualified by 2025. Assistance 
has been provided to technicians to obtain  
NVQ 4 certification and 219 technicians 
obtained NVQ4 certification in 2022.

SL TTDC was able to obtain NVQ 6 level  
from Tertiary and Vocational Education 
Commission (TVEC) to Pearson BTEC Higher 
National Diploma in Electrical and Electronics 
Engineering Higher National Diploma 
programme conducted in Welisara Centre. This 
is the first time in Sri Lanka that educational 
institute has obtained NVQ level 6 to Pearson 
Higher National Diploma.
Harnessing T acit Knowledge
As part of its quality management initiatives, SL T 
has implemented a range of quality circles that 
assist brainstorming and knowledge sharing. 
This facilitates employees’ tacit knowledge to 
be passed on to staff members frequently. New 
policies are being introduced for employees 
to encourage them to attain Professional 
Memberships, PhDs etc.
Another method of encouraging the flow 
of tacit knowledge was getting the retired 
staff members to the SL TTDC to share their 
knowledge with students and employees in the 
capacity of advisors and trainers. Necessary 
policies and procedures were implemented in 
this regard in 2022.

Employee Engagement
During 2022, SL T introduced an inclusive 
management concept to nurture a harmonious 
environment for management, employees, 
and trade unions. This was developed to drive 
active participation and contributions that 
would aid the development of organisational 
and operational key performance indicators. 
This was done with the involvement of TUs for 
operational work such as Customer Premises 
Equipment (CPE) collection, New Connections, 
Pole Recovery, and Bill Arrears collections. 
Strategic programmes were initiated across the 
island to improve operational excellence while 
solutions for cost estimation and optimisation 
were also provided. 
Some of the strategic programmes 
implemented were:
  Recovery of Customer premises  
equipment (CPE)
 T aking into consideration the foreign 
exchange (forex) restrictions and import 
bans enforced within Sri Lanka, a programme 
was developed through the collaboration 
of SL T’s management and trade unions 
to collect non-functional devices. This 
collection programme allowed SL T to  
recycle its CPEs and focus on repairing  
non-functioning equipment that can be 
reused thereafter .
  Organised deployments
 SL T initiated providing new connections 
programme, with the assistance of the trade 
unions in an organised and efficient manner .
  T elephone poles recovery
 Pole recovery efforts were implemented 
due to the rising costs of pole replacement. 
This led to the identification and marking of 
telephone poles around the island that can 
be reused and attending to their reutilisation 
in a resourceful manner .
Diversity in the Workplace
SL T has a broad cross-section of individuals 
working under one roof. The Company’s 
workforce includes Gen X, Gen Y , and Gen Z 
employees, which has brought in a diverse 
mix of talents and skills that are being shared 
amongst different age groups of employees.
T o further diversify the work environment,  
SL T aims to introduce a job rotation programme 
that allows exposure and diverse experiences. 
SL T employees working in different regions 
will be allowed to swap locations that would 
enhance the cultural diversity of the Company. 
Secondment opportunities are offered to  
staff within SL T , as well as those in its  
subsidiary companies.
Gender Parity
SL T refrains from practising any form of 
gender discrimination and encourages equal 
opportunities among its employees, regardless 
of gender , race, religion, or disability. However , 
the Company acknowledges that its workforce 
is largely male-dominated in field operations 
due to the nature of the work required. Overall, 
a ratio of 25:75 of women to men constitutes 
SL T’s workforce.
As per the Company’s Code, no employee 
will be discriminated due to ethnicity, religion, 
gender , politics, profession, and/or disability. 
All employees have a right to dignity at the 
workplace. Hence, SL T is responsible to provide 
a safe working place and an environment which 
is free from any form of sexual harassment. 
Any case of sexual harassment is required to be 
immediately reported to the Office of Business 
Practice for investigation and appropriate 
disciplinary action if proven.

for all staff members with Head Office

resolve customer issues within a minimum 
time frame. They included a team of 
120 representatives covering the entire 
stakeholder group serving the SL T -MOBITEL

development, monthly reviews and training 
programmes are conducted for the 
CxEMOs. In addition to the monthly reviews, 
an annual convention vis-à-vis the  
Customer Experience Management (CXM) 
Forum is conducted to get the pulse of 
the customers via the CxEMOs for further 
development initiatives.

In 2022, improvements were made 
to customer engagement channels

Organisation and the customer:
 Features of the MySL T portal and

an increase in online subscriptions. 
The unified platform empowers 
customers to manage a range of 
services, thereby enriching their 
experience.
 Interactive Voice Response (IVR) 
enhancement for automated service 
inquiries, product activations, and

empowered to deliver 
an enhanced customer 
experience, and reduce 
operational costs through the 
introduction of e-bills, SMS 
bills, and an in-app bill facility, 
which have helped to mitigate 
any postal delays and paper 
shortages as well.

Customer Satisfaction Scores
Value
Year end customer satisfaction index 83
Net promoter score 55  
Customer satisfaction is critical to SL T , and 
therefore, customer experience is vital to 
gaining relevant insights. SL T continued to 
implement several measures to manage 
the customer experience. The Company 
conducts daily customer satisfaction surveys 
to understand the voice of the customer , and 
an Annual Survey to derive insights on the 
Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI),  
Net Promoter Score (NPS), First-time 
Resolution Index, and Time to Resolve Index. 
The surveys focus on all three customer 
segments across the island, covering all seven 
regions, and touchpoints. According to the 
month-on-month survey, overall customer 
satisfaction improved to over 80%, with 
immediate escalation and rectification  
activities being carried out to settle certain 
customer pain points.
Employee Engagement
Initiatives to increase staff engagement were 
introduced – such as Customer Experience 
Forums – to deliver an improved experience to 
customers. Opportunities were extended to 
employees to provide their suggestions for the 
improvement of the customer experience.
Customer Enablement via  
Digital Means
With the digital customer experience being the 
future, SL T has enlisted the support of other 
stakeholders in related efforts.
Customer Loyalty
SL T focuses on building a long-term relationship 
with existing customers, with the aim of 
maintaining its customer base and enhancing 
revenue growth, by delivering customer 
convenience throughout the customer journey, 
from service subscriptions to usage, change, 
and modifying stages. T o achieve this, various 
loyalty programme initiatives have been 
introduced to recognise long-term customers.
The Customer for Life programme is in place 
to enhance loyalty and provide updates on new 
product and service offerings directly to the 
customer . The service assurance priority also 
caters to Platinum customers, attending to 
faults and trouble tickets raised by them.
In addition to the CRM system that includes 
a loyalty module, SL T’s points-based loyalty 
system helps to identify customer loyalty and 
the value of customers.
During the year , as part of SL T’s loyalty 
initiatives, articles on selected customers 
were featured in the Profit Magazine from May 
2022 onwards. This enabled the promotion 
of customers’ businesses whilst contributing 
towards the development of SME businesses. 
The introduction of the insurance scheme for 
SME customers in collaboration with Ceylinco 
Insurance helped to lend the necessary support 
and assurance in times of difficulty.
Moving forward, SL T will focus on expanding 
from customer loyalty to customer 
empowerment, by using data analytics to 
ascertain customer requirements to deliver 
a personalised service focused on technical 
empowerment as well.
Service Assurance
SL T has focused on reducing the number of 
faults reported, by effecting improvements 
to the access network, conducting quality 
improvements in customer premises 
equipment (service fulfilment), and conducting 
regular health checks of active network 
elements. Service assurance is further improved 
through the employment of multi-skilled 
workers in SL T’s field operations.

SL T’s contact centre plays a vital role in providing 
support services to all customers, by enabling 
access via various channels, mainly for fault 
reporting, bill inquiries and complaints, data (GB) 
requirements, and package modifications as 
inbound requests. Customers also reach out to 
the contact centre to obtain eChannelling, rail 
ticketing services, and for directory information.
The contact centre serves customers mainly 
via an automated and digital platform, with the 
provision of obtaining agent assisted service 
upon customer request. The main contact 
centre hotline “1212” provides service through 
voice calls, an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) 
service, and an agent assisted service. The 
0112 121212 number provides customers only 
with an IVR service to fulfil frequent customer 
inquiries, such as data (GB) requirements and 
bill inquiries. Other emerging digital channels, 
such as emails, are mostly used by business 
customers, while social media channels are 
mostly used by Gen Z customers. SMS service is 
offered to all customers despite the type of the 
mobile they use.

In 2022, out of 13.2 million inbound interactions 
received to the contact centre, 52% were 
served through the automated channels of 
IVR and SMS. The other 48% were served by 
a human agent, via voice calls, emails and as 
responses to social media messages. As a 
measure of increasing the level of automation 
at contact centres, in 2022 the requirement 
of the chatbot service was identified and 
initiated a project, with the intention of offering 
chatbot services to customers in 1H 2023. With 
improved automation, SL T intends to provide a 
superior experience to customers, by enabling 
instant access to contact centre without being 
in a queue, and being recognised as an “always 
connected” service.
SL T’s contact centre is also equipped to provide 
a proactive outbound service to customers 
through voice calls, where contact centre 
agents reach out to customers mainly for 
payment reminders, to create awareness of 
digital customer service channels and to serve 
customers who have opted for the Book a Call 
service. In 2022, 45,000 calls, on average, were 
originated to customers from the outbound 
channel through an auto dialler , to access 
customers more efficiently.
In the year under review, a new service was 
introduced allowing customers to book a call 
within the day. This “Book a Call” service gives 
customers access to contact centre agent 
service at the booked time slot, where they will 
receive a call from the agent to address their 
query. On average, 2,000 such book-a-call 
requests have been received per month since 
launch, with an average of 93% of customers 
stating that they are satisfied with the service.
With the normalisation of business operations 
in the country in post COVID environment, 
especially in Q4 2022, the demand for customer 
service dropped to the normal range of 30,000 
interactions per day. In this context, SL T decided 
to operate the agent service in a way, to 
optimise operational costs whilst improving the 
quality of service.
Nevertheless, in 2022, SL T invested in more 
than 1,500 hours of training for contact centre 
agents. Agents were given motivational training 
as they returned to working on-site, following 
a period of remote work during COVID-19 
lockdowns. Focus was given to further 
developing their soft skills towards greater 
efficiency, and ensuring the continued delivery 
of a professional service.

Management Approach
In carrying out its operations, SL T acknowledges 
its heavy impact on the environment, pertaining

the Company has given utmost precedence 
towards sustainable solutions and the 
structuring of a sustainable lifestyle within SL T . 
It also seeks to reduce any adverse effects 
the Company’s processes may have on the 
environment, whilst also creating environmental 
awareness among its employees and the public. 
The Company’s approach revolves around 
three main pillars - energy management, waste 
management, and ecosystem preservation. 
The three pillars are continuously monitored 
by an Energy Management Committee, which 
was appointed to screen and regulate efficient 
operations under the guidance of the SL T 
management team.
Strategic Focus Areas

Strategies
Commanding its way toward reducing its carbon 
footprint, SL T has transformed company ethics 
towards assessing all its business segments 
and opting to reduce, reuse and recycle. The 
Company’s main directive of building a sound-
material-cycle society has launched several 
environmentally sustainable initiatives, such 
as the repair and reuse of customer premises 
equipment for maintenance purposes. Following 
the 3R concept, the waste management 
implementations focus solely on paper waste, 
food waste, and e-waste. In collaboration with 
environmental certified institute in Sri Lanka, 
SL T coordinates the safe disposal of waste and 
directs techniques involved in reducing, reusing, 
and recycling. The Company has established 
its own copper recycling plant to facilitate the 
recycling of many unused copper cables which 
can be re-sold to suppliers in need of material.

greenhouse gases within the environment. 
Furthermore, this initiative aims to safeguard 
biodiversity across multiple areas in Sri Lanka, 
whilst raising awareness among the locals.

goals, SL T improved its communication among 
its employees. Furthermore, emails and posters 
were shared, and seminars on sustainability 
were conducted throughout the year . Field 
staff were continuously engaged in learning 
new technology such as 4G L TE/5G and/
Fibre and IT systems. This helps to create a 
better environment, by mitigating pollution and 
achieving effective resource utilisation.

could result in a potential conflict of auditor 
independence.

in place and evaluates the avenues for revenue 
loss and corrective actions taken to avoid 
possible revenue loss to the Company. The 
Detections are achieved by both manual and 
automated means. T ypical detection activities

information, processes, systems, technology or 
organisation.

consistently for optimum decision making in 
the face of uncertainty, to safeguard customers 
and stakeholders, protect the Company, and 
drive growth. Furthermore, risk management 
helps to identify and manage risks to reduce 
the uncertainty associated with executing 
business strategies, and capitalise on emerging 
opportunities. In addition, the Company’s risk 
assessment and response strategy is aligned 
with the strategic direction of the organisation.
Risk Leadership and 
Governance 
The senior management sets the tone for risk 
management throughout the Organisation. 
SL T’s leadership strongly endorses and supports 
risk management, and is constantly engaged 
in risk management activities, ensuring that 
risks are carefully taken into consideration in 
the formulation of key business processes 
and decisions. Risks that take various forms, 
can exert a material adverse impact on the 
Company’s reputation, operations, human 
resources, and financial performance. SL T’s

tolerance levels, the risk factors, and the risk 
management approach.

T o the Shareholders of Sri Lanka T elecom PLC
Report on the audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (the 
Company) and the consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and 
its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the Statement of Financial 
Position as at 31 December 2022, and the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Cash Flows for 
the year then ended, and Notes to the Financial Statements, including a 
summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying Financial Statements of the Company 
and the Group give a true and fair view of the financial position of the 
Company and the Group as at 31 December 2022, and of their financial 
performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with  
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards 
(SLAuSs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with 
the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka (Code of Ethics) and we have 
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of 
Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, 
were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of the 
current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each 
matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is 
provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our 
report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit 
included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Financial 
Statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures 
performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit 
opinion on the accompanying Financial Statements.
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition of fixed telephony and mobile 
communication services
Our audit procedures included the following key procedures;
The Group recognised revenue of LKR 105,195 Mn. from the provision  
of fixed telephony & mobile communication services for the year ended 
31 December 2022 in accordance with its accounting policy set out in 
Note 3 (k) and disclosed in Note 6 (a) to the Financial Statements.
Recognition of revenue from the provision of fixed telephony & mobile 
communication services was a key focus of our audit due to:
  Complexity in revenue recognition as a result of:
I. Frequent changes in rate structures and arrangements with multiple 
product features.
II. Large volume of transactions which arise from sales of different 
combinations of hardware and services.
III. Multiple IT systems which are used to capture, process and record 
the revenue.
  Evaluated the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of 
IT dependent manual controls and manual controls over the capture 
and measurement of revenue transactions.
  Evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of IT General 
Controls and IT Application Controls of IT systems having significant 
impact over revenue recognition and the adequacy of controls 
implemented for security monitoring aspects over selected IT systems 
related to revenue recognition with the assistance of our internal 
specialised resources.
  Performed re-computations and testing end-to-end reconciliations in 
relation to capture and measurement of revenue transactions,  
as relevant.

Independent Auditors’ Report 
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
  Significant judgement exercised by management when determining:
I. Whether to recognise revenue at a point in time or over a period for 
revenue arrangements
II. Duration of customer contracts
III. T ransaction price and allocating it to bundled products and services
  Assessed the reasonableness of significant judgements made by 
management when determining the timing of revenue recognition, 
duration of customer contracts and when allocating transaction 
price to performance obligations, based on the respective terms and 
conditions of customer contracts.
  Assessed the adequacy of related disclosures reflected in Note 3 (k) 
and Note 6 (a) of the Financial Statements.
Carrying Value of Network Assets Our audit procedures included the following key procedures;
As at 31 December 2022, the Group’s network assets accounted  
for 50% of the consolidated total assets and Group’s capital work in 
progress related to such network assets accounted for 10% of the 
consolidated total assets.
Carrying value of network assets was a key focus of our audit due to:
I. Materiality of the reported depreciation on network assets  
which amounted to LKR 19,303 Mn. for the year ended  
31 December 2022.
II. Judgements associated with estimating the useful lives of the 
network assets by the Company. It involves the Group’s collective 
assessment of the industry practice, internal technical evaluation 
and experience with the similar assets in concluding the useful 
economic life of the network assets.
III. The degree of assumptions, judgements and estimates associated 
with the estimated future cashflows used for the value in use 
calculations of selected network assets.
IV . The degree of judgement involved, and assumptions used when 
assessing impairment of amounts of capital work-in-progress 
relevant to network assets.
V . The timing of recognition of commissioned assets from capital 
work-in-progress to network assets considering the significant 
judgements involved and appropriateness of the date from which 
network assets commenced being depreciated.
  Evaluated the Group's process in estimating the useful lives of network 
assets by:
  assessing the judgements used by the Group on appropriateness 
of the useful lives of network assets applied in the calculation of 
depreciation.
  testing the underlying data on estimated useful lives against industry 
data and practice and other relevant external data.
  Gained an understanding of how the management has forecasted 
its discounted cash flows of selected network assets and tested 
the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the 
management.
  Assessed and evaluated the management's impairment assessment 
of network assets including the judgements made by the management 
on:
– the nature and impact of changes on the business strategy and 
business environment including which specific assets are impacted; 
and
– the extent of the impact of these changes on the carrying value of 
identified network assets
  Assessed the reasonableness of management judgements applied 
and assumptions used in relation to capital work-in-progress of 
network assets including possible indicators of impairment which 
were identified by the management for any project related to network 
assets which have not been commissioned for a prolonged period, 
based on our knowledge of the business and industry.
  Through discussion with the respective project managers and 
inspection of relevant documentation,
– evaluated the current status of completion of those projects in 
relation to budgeted project duration and
– assessed whether amounts related to network assets commissioned 
for use have been appropriately transferred out of capital work-in-
progress and recognised under the relevant class of property, plant 
and equipment, on a timely basis
  Determined the appropriateness of capitalisation of cost for network 
assets during the year , on sample basis.
  Assessed the adequacy of related disclosures reflected in Note 3 (d) 
and Note 13 of the Financial Statements.
The Group’s disclosures on property and equipment are included in  
Notes 3 (d) and 13 to the consolidated Financial Statements and the 
disclosures on capital work-in-progress are included in Notes 3 (d) (iv)  
and 13 to the consolidated Financial Statements.

Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
Other Information included in the 2022 Annual Report
Other information consists of the information included in the Annual 
Report, other than the Financial Statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. Management is responsible for the other information.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the  
other information and we do not express any form of assurance 
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our  
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,  
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent  
with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we 
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of  
this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the management and those charged 
with governance
Management is responsible for the preparation of Financial Statements 
that give a true and fair view in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting 
Standards, and for such internal control as management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error .
In preparing the Financial Statements, management is responsible for 
assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the 
Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the 
Company’s and the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’ s responsibilities for the audit of  
the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error , and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  
We also:
  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of  
the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error , design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error , as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,  
or the override of internal control.
  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit 
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the internal controls of the Company and the Group.
  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made 
by management.
  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going 
concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions 
that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we 
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the Financial Statements or , if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However , 
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue 
as a going concern.
  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial 
Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial 
Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business activities within the Group to 
express an opinion on the consolidated Financial Statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among 
other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant 
audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that 
we have complied with ethical requirements in accordance with the Code 
of Ethics regarding independence, and to communicate with them all 
relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear 
on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, 
we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of 
the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless 
law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in 
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing 
so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits 
of such communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
As required by section 163 (2) of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007, we 
have obtained all the information and explanations that were required for 
the audit and as far as appears from our examination, proper accounting 
records have been kept by the Group.

(All amounts in Sri Lanka Rupees million)
1. Reporting Entity
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (the “Company”) is a 
company domiciled in Sri Lanka. The address 
of the Company’s registered office is Lotus 
Road, Colombo 1. The Separate Financial 
Statements relates to Sri Lanka Telecom 
PLC. The Consolidated Financial Statements 
of the Company as at and for the year ended 
December 2022 comprise the Company and

The Financial Statements of all companies 
within the Group are prepared for a common 
financial year which ends on 31 December 2022.
The Group is primarily involved in providing a 
broad portfolio of telecommunication services 
across Sri Lanka. In addition, the range of 
services provided by the Group include,

domestic and international leased circuits, 
broadband, satellite uplink, maritime 
transmission, IPTV service, directory publishing 
and provision of manpower . The Company is a 
quoted public company which is listed on the 
Colombo Stock Exchange.
2. Basis of Preparation
(a) Statement of compliance
The Financial Statements of the Group and  
the Company which comprises the statement 
of financial position, statement of profit or loss 
and other comprehensive income, statement  
of changes in equity and statement of cash 
flows have been prepared in accordance with  
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRS and 
LKAS) as laid down by The Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) and  
the requirements of the Companies Act  
No. 07 of 2007.
(b) The Financial Statements were  
authorised for issue by the Board of Directors  
in accordance with the resolution of the 
Directors on 30 March  2023.
(c) Basis of measurement
The Financial Statements have been prepared 
on the historical cost basis applied consistently 
with no adjustments being made for inflationary 
factors affecting the Financial Statements 
except for the following item:
The liability for defined benefit obligation 
recognised is actuarially valued and recognised 
at the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation.
(d) Functional and  
presentation currency
These Financial Statements are presented in 
Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the Company’s 
functional currency and the Group’s 
presentation currency. All financial information 
presented in rupees has been rounded to the 
nearest million, unless otherwise indicated.
(e) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements in 
conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards 
requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and in 
any future periods affected.
Information about significant areas of 
estimation uncertainty and critical judgements 
in applying accounting policies that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the Financial Statements is 
included in the following notes:
  Note 13 – Property, plant and equipment
  Note 14  – Right-of-use assets and  
lease liabilities
  Note 15 – Intangible assets
  Note 20 – T rade and other receivable
  Note 24 – Deferred tax liabilities and assets
  Note 25 – Deferred Income, contract assets 
and contract liabilities
  Note 28 – Employee benefits
(f ) Current versus non-current 
classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in 
the statement of financial position based on 
current/non-current classification.
An asset is current when it is:
  Expected to be released or intended to be 
sold or consumed in the normal operating 
cycle
  Held primarily for the purpose of trading
  Expected to be realised within 12 months 
after the reporting period
Or
  Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle a 
liability for at least 12 months after  
the reporting period
  All other assets are classified as  
non-current.
A liability is current when:
  It is expected to be settled in the normal 
cycle
  It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
  It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period
  There is no unconditional right to defer  
the settlement of the liability for at least  
12 months after the reporting period
  The terms of the liability that could, at 
the option of the counterparty, result 
in its settlement by the issue of equity 
instruments do not affect its classification
  The Group classifies all other liabilities as 
non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified 
as non-current assets and liabilities.
(g) Going concern
The Financial Statements have been prepared 
on a going concern basis. The Directors have 
considered the potential downsides that the 
current economic conditions of Sri Lanka could 
bring to business operations of the Group in 
making this assessment. Impact of the current 
economic conditions is described in Note 37.
3. Significant  
Accounting Policies
The accounting policies set out below  
have been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in Financial Statements, and have 
been applied consistently by the Group 
entities, except amendments to existing 
accounting standards which are effective from 
01 January 2022 as described in Note 3 (W).

(a) Basis of consolidation
(i) Business combinations
The Group accounts for business combinations 
using the acquisition method when control is 
transferred to the Group. The consideration 
transferred in acquisition is generally measured 
at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets 
acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested 
annually for impairment. Any gain or bargain 
purchase is recognised in profit or loss 
immediately. T ransaction costs are expensed as 
incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or 
equity securities.
The consideration transferred does not  
include amounts related to the settlement  
of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts  
are generally recognised in statement of  
profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration is measured 
at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an 
obligation to pay contingent consideration that 
meets the definition of a financial instrument 
is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured 
and settlement is accounted for within equity. 
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value 
of the contingent consideration are recognised 
in statement of profit or loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for 
non-controlling interests and any previous 
interest held over the net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed). If the fair value 
of the net assets acquired is in excess of the 
aggregate consideration transferred, the Group 
reassesses whether it has correctly identified 
all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities 
assumed and reviews the procedures used to 
measure the amounts to be recognised at the 
acquisition date. If the reassessment still results 
in an excess of the fair value of net assets 
acquired over the aggregate consideration 
transferred, then the recognised in statement 
of profit or loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured 
at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is from the acquisition date, allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities 
of the acquire are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-
generating unit (CGU) and part of the operation 
within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill 
associated with the disposed operation is 
included in the carrying amount of the operation 
when determining the gain or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is 
measured based on the relative values of  
the disposed operation and the portion of  
the cash-generating unit retained.
(ii) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by 
the Group. The Group controls an entity when 
it is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has 
the ability to affect those returns through its 
power over the Consolidation of a subsidiary 
begins when the Group obtains control over the 
subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses 
control over the subsidiary.
As per the reporting date the Group has 
changed the accounting treatment of its 
investments in SL T Campus (Private) Limited 
from a subsidiary to non-current assets held for 
sale as per the “SLFRS 5 - Non-current Assets 
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” as 
disclosed in Notes 16.1 and 22.
(ii-a) Critical judgements in applying 
the entity's accounting policies
The Directors have concluded that the Group 
controls all subsidiaries as it has majority 
control and voting rights over its subsidiaries as 
depicted in Note (ii-b).

(iii) Equity – accounted investees 
(Investment in associates and  
joint ventures)
An associate is an entity over which the Group 
has significant influence. Significant influence 
is the power to participate in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee but is 
not control or joint control over those policies.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement 
whereby the parties that have joint control 
of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions 
about the relevant activities require unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining 
significant influence or joint control is similar 
to those necessary to determine control over 
subsidiaries. The Group’s investments in its 
associates and joint venture are accounted for 
using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in  
an associate or a joint venture is initially 
recognised at cost. The carrying amount of  
the investment is adjusted to recognise 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets 
of the associate or joint venture since the 
acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the 
associate or joint venture is included in  
the carrying amount of the investment and is 
not tested for impairment separately.
The statement of profit or loss reflects  
the Group’s share of the results of operations 
of the associate or joint venture. Any change 
in other comprehensive income of those 
investees is presented as part of the Group’s 
other comprehensive income. In addition,  
when there has been a change recognised 
directly in the equity of the associate or joint 
venture, the Group recognises its share of any 
changes, when applicable, in the statement of 
changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses 
resulting from transactions between the Group 
and the associate or joint venture are eliminated 
to the extent of the interest in the associate or 
joint venture.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit  
or loss of an associate and a joint venture is 
shown on the face of the statement of profit 
or loss outside operating profit and represents 
profit or loss after tax and non-controlling 
interests in the subsidiaries of the associate or 
joint venture.
The Financial Statements of the associate 
or joint venture are prepared for the same 
reporting period as the Group. When necessary, 
adjustments are made to bring the accounting 
policies in line with those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the 
Group determines whether it is necessary to 
recognise an impairment loss on its investment 
in its associate or joint venture. At each 
reporting date, the Group determines whether 
there is objective evidence that the investment 
in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If 
there is such evidence, the Group calculates 
the amount of impairment as the difference 
between the recoverable amount of the 
associate or joint venture and its carrying value, 
and then recognises the loss as “Share of profit 
or loss of equity-accounted investees” in the 
statement of profit or loss.
Upon loss of significant influence over the 
associate or joint control over the joint 
venture, the Group measures and recognises 
any retained investment at its fair value. Any 
difference between the carrying amount of 
the associate or joint venture upon loss of 
significant influence or joint control and the fair 
value of the retained investment and proceeds 
from disposal is recognised in the statement of 
profit or loss.
(iv) Non-controlling interest ( NCI)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share 
of acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date 
of acquisition. Changes in the group interest in 
a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control 
are accounted for as equity transactions.
(v) Loss of control
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, 
it derecognises the asset and liabilities of the 
subsidiary and any related NCI (if applicable) 
and other components of equity. Any resulting 
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any 
interest in the former subsidiary is measured at 
fair value when control is lost.
(vi) T ransaction eliminated on 
consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions and any 
unrealised income and expenses arising from 
intra-group transactions, are eliminated.
(b) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
T ransactions in foreign currencies are translated 
into the respective functional currencies of 
Group companies at the exchange rates  
at the date of the transaction. Monetary  
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the functional 
currency at the exchange rate at the reporting 
date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that 
are measured at fair value in a foreign currency 
are translated into the functional currency 
at the exchange rate when the fair value was 
determined. Foreign currency differences  
are generally recognised in statement of profit 
or loss and other comprehensive income.  
Non-monetary items that are measured  
based on historical cost in a foreign currency  
are not translated.
(C) Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that  
gives rise to a financial asset of one entity  
and financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity.
(i) Financial assets
(i-i) Initial recognition and  
measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial 
recognition, as subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, Fair Value Through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) and Fair Value 
Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL).
The classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the financial asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics and the 
Group’s business model for managing them. 
With the exception of trade receivables that do 
not contain a significant financing component 
or for which the Group has applied the practical 
expedient, the Group initially measures a 
financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of 
a financial asset not at fair value through profit 
or loss, transaction costs. T rade receivables 
that do not contain a significant financing 
component or for which the Group has applied 
the practical expedient are measured at the 
transaction price as disclosed in Note 3 (k) – 
Revenue from contracts with customers.
In order for a financial asset to be classified 
and measured at amortised cost or fair value 
through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash 
flows that are “solely payments of principal 
138
Sri Lanka T elecom PLC  
Annual Report 2022
Notes to the Financial Statements 
Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
and interest (SPPI)” on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred to as 
the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument 
level. Financial assets with cash flows that are 
not SPPI are classified and measured at fair 
value through profit or loss, irrespective of the 
business model.
The Group’s business model for managing 
financial assets refers to how it manages its 
financial assets in order to generate cash flows. 
The business model determines whether cash 
flows will result from collecting contractual 
cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. 
Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their initial recognition unless the Group 
changes its business model for managing 
financial assets, in which case all affected 
financial assets are reclassified on the first day 
of the first reporting period following the change 
in the business model. Purchases or sales of 
financial assets that require delivery of assets 
within a time frame established by regulation 
or convention in the market place (regular way 
trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e.  
the date that the Group commits to purchase or 
sell the asset.
(i-ii) Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
financial assets are classified in four categories;
  Financial assets at amortised cost  
(debt instruments)
  Financial assets at fair value through OCI 
with recycling of cumulative gains and losses 
(debt instruments)
  Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI with no recycling of cumulative 
gains and losses upon derecognition (equity 
instruments)
  Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss
Financial assets at amortised cost  
(debt instruments)
The Group measures financial assets  
at amortised cost if both following conditions 
are met:
  The financial asset is held within a business 
model with the objective to hold financial 
assets in order to collect contractual cash 
flows, and
  The contractual terms of the financial  
asset give rise on specified dates to  
cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding.
Financial assets at amortised cost are 
subsequently measured using the effective 
interest rate (EIR) method and are subject to 
impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in 
profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, 
modified or impaired.
The Group’s financial assets at amortised  
cost include trade and other receivables, 
employee loans amounts due from related 
parties short term investments and cash and 
cash equivalents.
Financial assets at fair value through OCI 
(debt instruments)
The Group measures debt instruments at fair 
value through OCI if both of following conditions 
are met:
  The financial asset is held within a business 
model with the objective of both holding to 
collect contractual cash flows and selling, 
and
  The contractual terms of the financial asset 
give rise on specified dates to cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest 
on the principal amount outstanding.
For debt instruments at fair value through 
OCI, interest income, foreign exchange 
revaluation and impairment losses or reversals 
are recognised in the statement of profit or 
loss and computed in the same manner as for 
financial assets measured at amortised cost. 
The remaining fair value changes are recognised 
in OCI. Upon derecognition, the cumulative fair 
value change recognised in OCI is recycled to 
profit or loss.
Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI (equity instruments)
Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect 
to classify irrevocably its equity investments 
as equity instruments designated at fair value 
through OCI when they meet the definition of 
equity under LKAS 32 – “Financial Instruments: 
Presentation” and are not held for trading. The 
classification is determined on an instrument-
by-instrument basis.
Gains and losses on these financial assets are 
never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised as other income in the statement 
of profit or loss when the right of payment 
has been established, except when the Group 
benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of 
part of the cost of the financial asset, in which 
case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity 
instruments designated at fair-value-through 
OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.
This category includes listed and non-listed 
equity instruments that the Group elected to 
classify irrevocably.
Financial assets at fair value through  
profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial assets held for trading, 
financial assets designated upon initial 
recognition at fair value through profit or loss, 
or financial assets mandatorily required to be 
measured at fair value. Financial assets are 
classified as held for trading if they are acquired 
for the purpose of selling or repurchasing 
in the near term. Derivatives, including 
separated embedded derivatives, are also 
classified as held for trading unless they are 
designated as effective hedging instruments. 
Financial assets with cash flows that are not 
solely payments of principal and interest are 
classified and measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, irrespective of the business 
model. Notwithstanding the criteria for debt 
instruments to be classified at amortised cost 
or at fair value through OCI, as described above, 
debt instruments may be designated at fair 
value through profit or loss on initial recognition 
if doing so eliminates, or significantly reduces, 
an accounting mismatch.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss are carried in the statement of financial 
position at fair value with net changes in fair 
value recognised in the statement of profit or 
loss.
This category includes derivative instruments 
and listed equity investments which the Group 
had not irrevocably elected to classify at fair 
value through OCI. Dividends on listed equity 
investments are also recognised as other 
income in the statement of profit or loss when 
the right of payment has been established.
A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, 
with a financial liability or non-financial host, 
is separated from the host and accounted 
for as a separate derivative if: the economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related 
to the host; a separate instrument with the 
same terms as the embedded derivative would 
meet the definition of a derivative; and the 
hybrid contract is not measured at fair value 
through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives are 
measured at fair value with changes in fair value 
recognised in profit or loss. Reassessment only 
occurs if there is either a change in the terms 
139
Sri Lanka T elecom PLC  
Annual Report 2022
Notes to the Financial Statements 
Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
of the contract that significantly modifies the 
cash flows that would otherwise be required or a 
reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair 
value through profit or loss category.
(i-iii) Fair value measurement
SLFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that 
would be received to sell and asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transactions 
between market participants at the 
measurement date.
A fair value measurement requires an entity to 
determine all the following;
1.  The particular asset or liability that is the 
subject of the measurement.
2.  For a non-financial asset, the valuation 
premise that is appropriate for the 
measurement (consistently with its highest 
and best use).
3.  The principal (or most advantageous) 
market for the asset or liability.
4.  The valuation technique(s) appropriate 
for the measurement, considering the 
availability of data with which to develop 
inputs that represent the assumptions  
that market participants would use when 
pricing the asset or liability and the level 
of the fair value hierarchy within which the 
inputs are categorised.
5.  Fair value is a market-based measurement, 
not an entity-specific measurement. For 
some assets and liabilities, observable 
market transactions or market.
When transaction price provides the best 
evidence of fair value at initial recognition, the 
financial instrument is initially measured at the 
transaction price and any difference between 
this price and the value initially obtained from a 
valuation model is subsequently recognised in 
profit or loss on an appropriate basis over the 
life of the instrument but not later than when 
the valuation is supported wholly by observable 
market data or the transaction is closed out.
Determination of fair values
The determination of fair value for financial 
assets and liabilities for which there is no 
observable market price requires the use of 
valuation techniques. For financial instruments 
that trade infrequently and have little price 
transparency, fair value is less objective 
and requires varying degrees of judgement 
depending on liquidity, concentration, 
uncertainty of market factors, pricing 
assumption and other risks affecting the 
specific instrument.
– Level 1 – Fair value measurements using 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities;
– Level 2 – Fair value measurements using 
inputs other than quoted prices included 
within Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
– Level 3 – Fair value measurements using 
inputs for the asset or liability that are 
not based on observable market data (i.e. 
unobservable inputs).
(i-iv) Amortised cost
The amortised cost of a financial asset or 
liability is the amount at which the financial asset 
or liability is measured at initial recognition, 
minus principal repayments, plus or minus the 
cumulative amortisation using the effective 
interest method of any difference between 
the initial amount recognised and the maturity 
amount, minus any reduction for impairment.
(i-v) Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
Financial assets not classified at fair value 
through profit or loss, are assessed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is 
objective evidence of impairment.
Objective evidence that financial assets are 
impaired includes:
– default or delinquency by a debtor;
– restructuring of an amount due to the Group 
on terms that the Group would not consider 
otherwise;
– indications that a debtor or issuer will enter 
bankruptcy;
– adverse changes in the payment status of 
borrowers or issuers;
– the disappearance of an active market for a 
security; or
– Observable data indicating that there is a 
measurable decrease in the expected cash 
flows from a group of financial assets.
In addition, for an investment in an equity 
security, a significant or prolonged decline  
in its fair value below its cost is objective 
evidence of impairment.
For trade receivables and contract assets, 
the Group applies a simplified approach in 
calculating expected credit losses (ECLs). 
Therefore, the Group does not track changes 
in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss 
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 
reporting date. The Group has established a 
provision metrix that is based on its historical 
credit loss experience adjusted for forward 
looking factors specific to the debtors and the 
economic environment.
The Group considers a financial asset in default 
when contractual payments are 90 days past 
due. However , in certain cases, the Group may 
also consider a financial asset to be in default 
when internal or external information indicates 
that the Group is unlikely to receive the 
outstanding contractual amounts in full before 
taking into account any credit enhancements 
held by the Group. A financial asset is written 
off when there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovering the contractual cash flows.
Investments in fixed deposits , T reasury Bills and 
Bonds are considered as low risk of default.
Non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its non-financial assets 
(other than investment property, inventories 
and deferred tax assets) to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually 
for impairment.
For impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets that 
generates cash inflows from continuing use that 
are largely independent of the cash inflows of 
other assets or CGUs.
Goodwill arising from a business combination is 
allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is 
the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the 
estimated future cash flows, discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset or CGU.
140
Sri Lanka T elecom PLC  
Annual Report 2022
Notes to the Financial Statements 
Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying 
amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its 
recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit  
or loss. They are allocated first to reduce  
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a 
pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not 
reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, 
net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.
(i-vi) Hedge
For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument is initially recognised 
directly in equity in the “cash flow hedge 
reserve”. The ineffective portion of the gains or 
losses on the hedge instrument is recognised 
immediately in the profit and loss.
When the hedge cash flow affect  
the Income Statement, the gain or loss on 
the hedging instrument is recorded in the 
corresponding income or expense line of  
the Income Statement. When a hedging 
instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, 
exercised or when a hedge no longer meet the 
criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gains/losses existing in other comprehensive 
income at that time remains in other 
comprehensive income and is recognised in the 
income statement. When a forecast transaction 
is no longer expected to occur the cumulative 
gains/loss was reported in other comprehensive 
income is immediately transferred to the 
Income Statement.
(ii) Financial liabilities
(ii-i) Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
payables, or as appropriate. 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at 
fair value and, in the case of loans, borrowings, 
vendor financing and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
The Group's financial liabilities include trade and 
other payables loans and borrowing including 
bank overdrafts, vendor financing lease liabilities, 
contract liabilities and deferred income.
(ii-ii) Subsequent measurement
This is the category most relevant to the 
Group. After initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings vendor financing are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the EIR method, after considering any discount 
or premium on acquisition and fees or costs 
that are an integral part of the EIR. Gains and 
losses are recognised in profit or loss when the 
liabilities are derecognised. EIR amortisation is 
included as finance costs in the statement of 
profit or loss.
(ii)-(iii) Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged or 
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial 
liability is replaced by another from the same 
lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially 
modified, such an exchange or modification 
is treated as the derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The 
difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
(iii) Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is reported in the 
consolidated statement of financial position 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to 
offset the recognised amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
The cost of self-constructed assets includes 
the cost of materials and direct labour and any 
other costs directly attributable to bringing the 
assets to a working condition for their intended 
use. Purchased software that is integral to 
the functionality of the related equipment is 
capitalised as part of that asset.
When parts of an item of property, plant and 
equipment have different useful lives, they 
are accounted for as separate items (major 
components) of property, plant and equipment.
(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is recognised in the 
carrying amount of the item if it is probable that 
the future economic benefits embodied within 
the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be 
measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day 
servicing of property, plant and equipment are 
recognised in profit or loss.
(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable 
amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other 
amount substituted for cost, less its residual 
value. Depreciation is recognised in profit or 
loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful lives of each part of an item of property, 
plant and equipment. In the year of acquisition 
depreciation is computed on proportionate 
basis from the month the asset is put into 
use and no depreciation will be charged to 
the month in which the particular asset was 
disposed. Leased assets are depreciated over 
the shorter of the lease term and their useful 
lives unless it is reasonably certain that the 
Group will obtain ownership by the end of the 
lease term. Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation method, useful lives and residual 
values are reviewed at each reporting date and 
adjusted if appropriate
The estimated useful lives for the assets are as 
follows:
Freehold buildings 5 – 40 years
Submarine cables 10 – 25 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
CDMA handsets 3 years
PABX system 1– 6 years
IT systems 5 – 10 years
Other fixed assets  2 – 12.5 years
Network equipment
Ducts, cables and other 
outside plant 5 – 20 years
Telephone exchanges and  
transmission equipment  5 –12.5 years
T owers 40 years

Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
(iv) Capital work-in-progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost 
net of accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
These are expenses of a capital nature directly 
incurred in the construction of buildings, 
network equipment, system development and 
other fixed assets, awaiting capitalisation.
Major spare parts and project related inventory 
qualify as property, plant and equipment  
when the entity expects to use them during 
more than one year period and are used in 
connection with specific items of property,  
plant and equipment.
(v) Derecognition
The carrying amount of an item of property, 
plant and equipment is derecognised on 
disposal. Gains and losses on disposal of an 
item of property, plant and equipment are 
determined by comparing the proceeds from 
disposal with the carrying amount of property, 
plant and equipment and are recognised net 
within “other income” in the statement of profit 
or loss and other comprehensive income.
When replacement costs are recognised  
in the carrying amount of an item of property, 
plant and equipment, the remaining carrying 
amount of the replaced part is derecognised. 
Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each 
such capitalisation, the remaining carrying 
amount of the previous cost of inspections  
is derecognised.
(vi) Borrowing cost
Borrowing cost directly attributable to  
the acquisition, construction or production of  
an asset that necessarily takes a substantial 
period of time to get ready for its intended use 
or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of  
the respective assets. All other borrowing 
costs are expensed in the period they occur . 
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other 
costs that an entity incurs in connection with 
the borrowing of funds.
(e) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries.
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of 
subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. For 
measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, 
see Note 3 (a) (i).
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are  
acquired by the Group, which have finite  
useful lives, are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
(iii) Licences
Separately acquired licences are shown at 
historical cost. Expenditures on licence fees 
that is deemed to benefit or relate to more than 
one financial year is classified as licence fee and 
is being amortised over the license period on a 
straight-line basis.
(iv) Subsequent expenditure
 Subsequent expenditure is capitalised 
only when it increases the future economic 
benefits embodied in the specific asset to 
which it relates. All other expenditure, including 
expenditure on internally generated goodwill is 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
(f ) Right-of-use assets and  
lease liabilities
Leases
The Group assesses at contract inception 
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That 
is, if the contract conveys the right to control the 
use of an identified asset for a period of time in 
exchange for consideration.
Group as a lessee
The Group applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except 
for short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities  
to make lease payments and right-of-use 
assets representing the right to use the 
underlying assets.
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at 
the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the 
date the underlying asset is available for use). 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less 
any accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, 
and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives 
received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the 
lease term and the estimated useful lives of the 
assets, as follows:
Leased assets Estimated useful lives
Buildings 2-3 years
T owers 2-3 years
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to 
the Group at the end of the lease term or the 
cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, 
depreciation is calculated using the estimated 
useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets 
are also subject to impairment as more fully 
described in Note (U) (ii) – Impairment of Assets.
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease,  
the Group recognises lease liabilities measured 
at the present value of lease payments to be 
made over the lease term. The lease payments 
include fixed payments (including in-substance 
fixed payments) less any lease incentives 
receivable, variable lease payments that depend 
on an index or a rate, and amounts expected 
to be paid under residual value guarantees. 
The lease payments also include the exercise 
price of a purchase option reasonably certain 
to be exercised by the Group and payments of 
penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease 
term reflects the Group exercising the option to 
terminate. Variable lease payments that do not 
depend on an index or a rate are recognised as 
expenses (unless they are incurred to produce 
inventories) in the period in which the event or 
condition that triggers the payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease 
payments, the Group uses its incremental 
borrowing rate at the lease commencement 
date because the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of 
interest and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease 
liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, 
a change in the lease term, a change in the lease 
payments (e.g. changes to future payments 
resulting from a change in an index or rate used 
to determine such lease payments) or a change 
in the assessment of an option to purchase the 
underlying asset.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
The Group’s lease liabilities are included in 
rights-of-use assets and lease liabilities in Note 
14 (a) to the Financial Statements.
Leases of low-value assets
The Group applies the lease of low-value assets 
recognition exemption to leases of some tower 
rentals that are considered to be low value. 
Lease payments on leases of low-value assets 
are recognised as expenses on straight-line 
basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor
Leases in which the Group does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership of an asset are classified as 
operating leases. Rental income arising is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the 
lease terms and is included in revenue in the 
statement of profit or loss due to its operating 
nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating 
and arranging an operating lease are added to 
the carrying amount of the leased asset and 
recognised over the lease term on the same 
basis as rental income. Contingent rents are 
recognised as revenue in the period in which 
they are earned.
(g) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost 
and net realisable value. The cost of inventories 
is based on the weighted average cost principle. 
Value of inventories includes expenditure 
incurred in acquiring, conversion costs and 
other costs incurred in bringing them to their 
existing location and condition.
(h) Share capital
Ordinary share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the 
issue of ordinary shares and share options are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net of 
any tax effects.
(i) Government grants
Government grants are recognised initially at 
fair value when there is reasonable assurance 
that they will be received and the Group 
will comply with the conditions associated 
with the grant. Grants that compensate the 
Group for expenses incurred are recognised 
in the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income as other income on 
a systematic basis in the same periods in 
which the expenses are recognised. Grants 
that compensate the Group for the cost of an 
asset are recognised in the of profit or loss on a 
systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.
(j) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-
employment benefit plan under which 
contributions are made into a separate fund 
and the entity will have no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations 
for contributions to defined contribution plan 
are recognised as an employee benefit expense 
in profit or loss in the periods during which 
services are rendered by employees. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to 
the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in 
future payments is available.
Employees' Provident Fund
All employees of the Company are members 
of the Sri Lanka Telecom Provident Fund to 
which the Company contributes 15% of such 
employees’ basic salary and allowances.
All employees of subsidiaries of the Group are 
members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), 
to which the respective subsidiaries contribute 
12% of such employees’ basic salary and 
allowances. Employees of Sri Lanka Telecom 
(Services) Limited are members of Employees’ 
Provident Fund (EPF), where the Company 
contribute 15% of such employees’ basic salary 
and allowances.
Employees' T rust Fund
The Company and other subsidiaries contribute 
3% of the salary of each employee to the 
Employees’ T rust Fund.
(ii) Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan other than a defined contribution 
plan. The defined benefit is calculated by  
an independent actuary using Projected  
Unit Credit method as recommended by  
LKAS 19 – “Employee Benefits” The present  
value of the defined benefit obligation is 
determined by discounting the estimated future 
cash outflows using the yield on Government 
Bonds at the reporting date and have maturity 
dates approximating to the terms of the 
Company’s obligations.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and  
losses that arise in calculating the Group’s 
obligation in respect of a plan in other 
comprehensive income. 
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation depends on a number of factors that 
are determined on an actuarial basis using a 
number of assumptions. Key assumptions used 
in determining the defined retirement benefit 
obligations are given in Note 26. Any changes 
in these assumptions will impact the carrying 
amount of defined benefit obligations."
Provision has been made for retirement 
gratuities from the first year of service  
for all employees, in conformity with 
LKAS 19 – “Employee Benefits”. However , 
under the Payment of Gratuity Act No.12 of 
1983, the liability to an employee arises only on 
completion of five years of continued service.
(iii) T ermination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an 
expense when the Group is demonstrably 
committed, without realistic possibility of 
withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either 
terminate employment before the normal 
retirement date, or to provide termination 
benefits as a result of an offer made to 
encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination 
benefits for voluntary redundancies are 
recognised as an expense if the Group has 
made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is 
probable that the offer will be accepted, and 
the number of acceptances can be estimated 
reliably.
(iv) Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are 
measured on an undiscounted basis and are 
expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected 
to be paid under short-term cash bonus or 
leave encashment plans if the Group has a 
present legal or constructive obligation to pay 
this amount as a result of past service provided 
by the employee and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably.
(k) Revenue from contracts with 
customers
The Group is primarily involved in providing a 
broad portfolio of telecommunication services 
across Sri Lanka. In addition, the range of 
services provided by the Group include,  
inter alia,, voice and broadband services, 
143
Sri Lanka T elecom PLC  
Annual Report 2022
Notes to the Financial Statements 
Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
domestic and international leased circuits, 
broadband, satellite up-link, maritime 
transmission, IPTV service, directory publishing 
service and educational services.
Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or 
services are transferred to the customer at an 
amount that reflects the consideration to which 
the Group expects to be entitled in exchange 
for those goods or services. The Group has 
generally concluded that it is the principal in its 
revenue arrangements.
(i) Performance obligations relevant 
to contacts
As a telecommunication service provider , 
the Group’s performance obligation related 
to service contracts include the installation 
services and maintenance services provided 
and the uninterrupted telecommunication 
service which will be provided throughout the 
connection period.
The Group expects that above performance 
obligations would be satisfied throughout the 
connection period.
Domestic and international call revenue 
and rental income
Fixed lines
Revenue for call time usage by customers 
is recognised as revenue as services are 
performed on accrual basis. Fixed rental is 
recognised as income on a monthly basis in 
relation to the period of services rendered.
Mobile revenue
Mobile revenue comprises amounts charged 
to customers in respect of monthly access 
charges, airtime usage, messaging, and the 
provision of other mobile telecommunications 
services. Mobile monthly access charges are 
invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing 
cycle. Airtime, either from contract customers 
as part of the invoiced amount or from prepaid 
customers through the sale of prepaid cards, is 
recorded in the period in which the customer 
uses the service.
Revenue from other network operators 
and international settlements
The revenue received from other network 
operators, local and international, for the use 
of the Group's telecommunication network are 
recognised, net of taxes, based on usage taking 
the traffic minutes/per second rates stipulated 
in the relevant agreements and regulations and 
based on the terms of the lease agreements for 
fixed rentals.
Revenue arising from the interconnection 
of voice and data traffic between other 
telecommunications operators is recognised at 
the time of transit across the Group’s network 
and presented on gross basis. The relevant 
revenue accrued is recognised under income 
in the income statement and interconnection 
expenses recognised under operating costs in 
profit or loss.
Revenue from broadband
Revenue from Data services and IPTV services 
is recognised on usage and the fixed rental on 
a monthly basis when it is earned net of taxes, 
rebates and discounts.
Revenue from other ICT services
The revenue from other telephone services are 
recognised on an accrual basis based on fixed 
rental contracts entered between the Group 
and subscribers.
Recognition of deferred income
The connection fees relating to Public Switch 
Telephone Network (PSTN) are deferred over 
a period of 15 years. Revenue is recognised 
on an annual basis irrespective of the date of 
connection.
IRU revenue relating to leasing of SEA-ME-WE 4 
cable capacity are recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the contracts. Amounts 
received in advance for any services are 
recorded as deferred revenue. In the event that 
a customer terminates an IRU prior to the expiry 
of the contract and releases the Company 
from the obligation to provide future services, 
the remaining unamortised deferred revenue 
is recognised in the period the contract is 
terminated.
Backhauling revenue which is leasing of  
SEA-ME-WE 3 cable capacity is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the period of contracts. 
Amounts received in advance for any services 
are recorded as deferred revenue.
Revenue from the sale of prepaid CDMA  
cards is deferred until such time as the 
customer uses the call time, downloadable 
quota or the credit expires.
Sale of mobile recharge cards and reloads  
for prepaid subscribers are initially recognised  
as deferred revenue until such time as  
the subscribers use the services or credit  
period expires.
(ii) New connection fees
The Group provides installation services 
relevant to the new connections of fixed and 
mobile telecommunication services including 
both voice and non-voice categories. These 
installation services are bundled together with 
providing of Customer Premises Equipment 
(CPE) to customers in fixed line voice and some 
non-voice services. When the performance 
obligations relevant to such installation services 
are performed, CPEs provided to customers 
are considered as assets of the Group as long 
as the contracts with customers are valid. 
Accordingly, the Group allocates a bundled price 
for the equipment and installation services for 
such facilities.
(iii) Recognition of contract liabilities
The Group concluded that revenue from 
new connections in fixed and mobile 
telecommunication services is to be recognised 
over time because the customer simultaneously 
receives and consumes the benefits provided 
by the Group. The fact that another entity 
would not need to reperform the installation 
of the service that the Group has provided 
to date demonstrates that the customer 
simultaneously receives and consumes the 
benefits of the Group’s performance as it 
performs.
The Group identifies the revenue for installation 
services as a contract liability and recognises the 
revenue on a systematic basis that is consistent 
with the entity’s transfer of the related goods or 
services to the customer since satisfaction for 
the installation services will be consumed by the 
customer over the contract period.
(iv) Costs incurred in securing 
customer contracts
The Group identifies the sales commission paid 
to sales team for each new connection contract 
and other such related costs in contract 
acquisition as costs incurred in securing 
customer contracts.
(v) Recognition of contract assets
Contract acquisition costs are recognised as 
a contract asset and subsequently recognised 
as an expense over the life of a contract on a 
systematic basis consistent with the pattern 
of the transfer of services to which the asset 
relates, that is; as and when the relevant 
performance obligation is fulfilled for  
a given month.
144
Sri Lanka T elecom PLC  
Annual Report 2022
Notes to the Financial Statements 
Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
(l) Expenditure
The expenses are recognised on an accrual 
basis. All expenses incurred in the ordinary 
course of business and in maintaining property, 
plant and equipment in a state of efficiency is 
charged against income in arriving at the profit 
for the year .
(m) Lease payments
Minimum lease payments made under finance 
leases are apportioned between the finance 
expense and the reduction of the outstanding 
liability. The finance expense is allocated to each 
period during the lease term so as to produce 
a constant periodic rate of interest on the 
remaining balance of the liability.
Contingent lease payments are accounted for 
by revising the minimum lease payments over 
the remaining term of the lease when the lease 
adjustment is confirmed. Determining whether 
an arrangement contains a lease.
At inception of an arrangement, the Group 
determines whether such an arrangement is or 
contains a lease. A specific asset is the subject 
of a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is 
dependent on the use of that specific asset. An 
arrangement conveys the right to use the asset 
if the arrangement conveys to the Group the 
right to control the use of the underlying asset.
(n) Finance income and expenses
The Group’s finance income and finance  
cost include:
  Interest income from repurchase 
agreements
  Interest income from fixed deposits
  Staff loan interest income
  Interest expense from borrowings
  Interest expense arising from Leases
  Foreign exchange gains or losses
Interest income or expense is recognised using 
the effective interest method. Dividend income 
is recognised in profit or loss on the date on 
which the Group’s right to receive payment is 
established.
(o) Income tax
Current income tax assets are measured at 
amount to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities.
(i) Current taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and 
deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised 
or profit or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, 
in which case it is recognised in equity or other 
comprehensive income.
Provisions for taxation is based on the profit 
for the year adjusted for taxation purposes 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 and the 
amendments thereto.
(ii) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not 
recognised for the following temporary 
differences; 
– The initial recognition of assets or liabilities in 
a transaction that is not a business combination 
and that affects neither accounting nor 
taxable profit or loss and differences relating 
to investments in nor taxable profit or loss 
and differences relating to investments in 
subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that 
they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
– Deferred tax is not recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on the initial 
recognition of goodwill. 
– Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, based on the 
laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities 
and assets, and they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same tax authority on the same 
taxable entity or on different tax entities, but 
they intend to settle current tax liabilities and 
assets on a net basis or their tax assets liabilities 
will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profits 
will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. Deferred tax is  
not recognised for the undistributed profits  
of subsidiaries as the parent Company 
has control over the dividend policy of its 
subsidiaries and distribution of those profits. 
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date and are reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised 
outside profit or loss, is recognised either in 
other comprehensive income or directly in 
statement of changes in equity in line with the 
underlying transaction.
(iii) Social Security  
Contribution Levy (SSCL)
According to the Social Security Contribution 
Levy Act No. 25 of 2022, Sri Lanka Telecom 
PLC is liable for Social Security Contribution 
Levy at 2.5% on the liable turnover arising 
from providing of a service with effect from 
1st October 2022.  
(iv) Sales tax
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised 
net of the amount of sale tax, except: where 
sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or 
services is not recoverable from the taxation 
authority, in which case the sales tax is 
recognised as part of the cost of acquisition 
of the asset or as part of expense item as 
applicable.
(v) Uncertainty over income  
tax treatment
The Group determines whether to consider 
each uncertain tax treatment separately or 
together with one or more other uncertain tax 
treatments and uses the approach that better 
predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.
The Group applies significant judgement in 
identifying uncertainties over income tax 
treatments and it assessed whether the 
interpretation had an impact on its consolidated 
Financial Statements.
If the Group concludes that it is probable 
that the taxation authority will accept the tax 
treatment used or planned to be used in its tax 
fillings, the entity determines its tax position 
on that basis. This is consistent with the 
requirement that current tax is measured at the 
amount expected to be paid or recovered from 
the taxation authorities, and that deferred tax is 
measured using the rates and tax laws expected 
to apply when the related asset is realised or 
liability is settled.
145
Sri Lanka T elecom PLC  
Annual Report 2022
Notes to the Financial Statements 
Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
If the Group concludes that acceptance of 
the uncertain tax treatment by the taxation 
authorities is not probable, it would apply one 
of the following two methods for reflecting 
the effect of uncertainty in its estimate of the 
amount it expects to pay or recover from the tax 
authorities.
a.  the most likely amount - the single most 
likely amount in a range of possible 
outcomes; or
b.  the expected value - the sum of the 
probability-weighted amounts in a range of 
possible outcomes.
The Group uses the method that is expects to 
better predict the resolution of the uncertainty.
(p) Earnings per share
The Group presents basic earnings per share 
(EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the 
Company by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit 
or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders 
and the weighted-average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares.
(q) Insurance reserve
Policy applied before 31 March 2022
The Company transfers annually from the 
retained earnings an amount equal to 0.25% 
of additions to property, plant and equipment 
to an insurance reserve. An equal amount is 
invested in a sinking fund to meet any funding 
requirements for potential losses from 
uninsured property, plant and equipment. The 
insurance reserve is maintained to recover any 
losses arising from damage to property, plant 
and equipment, except for motor vehicles, that 
are not insured with a third party insurer .
Policy applied after 31 March 2022 
SL T has obtained Property All Risk Insurance 
with effect from 31 March 2022 for targeted 
assets of SL T at island wide locations. In order 
to cover the exposure of remaining assets and 
possible further exposure LKR 300 Mn. has been 
retained in the insurance reserve from 2022 
onwards. There is no further contributions to 
the insurance fund due to the reason of annual 
renewal of Property All Risk policy of SL T .
(r) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s 
shareholders is recognised as a liability in the 
Group’s Financial Statements in the period 
in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
Provision for final dividends is recognised at the 
time the dividend recommended and declared 
by the Board of Directors, is approved by the 
shareholders.
(s) Comparatives
Except when a standard permits or requires 
otherwise, comparative information is disclosed 
in respect of the previous period. Where 
the presentation or classification of items 
in the Financial Statements are amended, 
comparative amounts are reclassified unless it 
is impracticable.
(t) Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows has been prepared 
using the “indirect method” of preparing 
cash flows in accordance with the Sri Lanka 
Accounting Standard (LKAS 07) – “Statement 
of Cash Flows”. Cash and cash equivalents 
comprise short-term, highly liquid investments 
that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
change in value. The cash and cash equivalent 
include cash in hand, balances with banks, 
placements with banks, money at call and short 
notice.
(u) Non-current assets held for sale
The Group classifies non-current assets and 
disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying 
amounts will be recovered principally through a 
sale transaction rather than through continuing 
use. Non-current assets and disposal groups 
classified as held for sale are measured at the 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental 
costs directly attributable to the disposal of an 
asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs 
and income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is 
regarded as met only when the sale is highly 
probable, and the asset or disposal group 
is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition. Actions required to complete the sale 
should indicate that it is unlikely that significant 
changes to the sale will be made or that the 
decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management 
must be committed to the plan to sell the asset 
and the sale expected to be completed within 
one year from the date of the classification.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets are not depreciated or amortised once 
classified as held for sale. Assets and liabilities 
classified as held for sale are presented 
separately as current items in the statement of 
financial position.
Additional disclosures are provided in Note 22.
(v) Critical accounting estimates, 
assumptions and judgements
In the preparation of these Financial 
Statements, a number of estimates and 
assumptions have been made relating to the 
performance and the financial position of the 
Group. Results may differ significantly from 
those estimates under different assumptions 
and conditions. The Directors consider 
that the following discussion addresses the 
Company's most critical accounting policies, 
which are those that are most important to 
the presentation of its financial performance 
and position. These particular policies require 
subjective and complex judgements, often as a 
result of the need to make estimates about the 
effect of matters that are uncertain.
(i) Depreciation of property, plant 
and equipment
The Company assigns useful lives and residual 
values to property, plant and equipment based 
on periodic studies of actual asset lives and 
the intended use for those assets. Changes in 
circumstances such as technological advances, 
prospective economic utilisation and physical 
condition of the assets concerned could result 
in the actual useful lives or residual values 
differing from initial estimates.
Where the Company determines that  
the useful life of property, plant and equipment 
should be shortened or residual value reduced, 
it depreciates the net carrying amount in  
excess of the residual value over the revised 
remaining useful life, thereby increasing 
depreciation expense. Any change in an 
asset's life or residual value is reflected in the 
Company's Financial Statements when  
the change in estimate is determined.

Annual Report 2022
Notes to the Financial Statements 
Preamble Executive Statements Business Context and Strategy Management Discussion and Analysis Governance Financial Reports Supplementary Information
(ii) Impairment of property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets
The Company assesses the impairment of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable or otherwise as required 
by accounting standards. Factors that are 
considered important and which could trigger 
an impairment review include the following;
a.  obsolescence or physical damage;
b.  significant changes in technology and 
regulatory environments;
c.  significant under performance relative to 
expected historical or projected future 
operating results;
d.  significant changes in the use of its assets or 
the strategy for its overall business;
The identification of impairment indicators, 
the estimation of future cash flows and the 
determination of the recoverable amount 
for assets or cash generating units require 
significant judgement.
(iii) Revenue recognition
Judgement is required in assessing the 
application of the principles of revenue 
recognition in respect of revenues. This includes 
presentation of revenue as principal or as agent 
in respect of income received from transmission 
of content provided by third parties.
(iv) Valuation of receivables
The provision for impairment losses for trade 
and other receivables reflects the Company's 
estimates of losses arising from the failure 
or inability of customers to make required 
payments. The provision is based on the ageing 
of customer accounts, customer credit-
worthiness and the Company's historical write-
off experience etc. Changes to the provision 
may be required if the financial condition of 
its customers improves or deteriorates. An 
improvement in financial condition may result in 
lower actual write-offs.
(v) Inventories
The Company assesses the inventory provision 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable or otherwise as required 
by accounting standards. Factors that are 
considered important and which could trigger 
an impairment review include the following;
a.  obsolescence or physical damage;
b.  significant changes in technology and 
regulatory environments;
c.  significant changes in the use of its assets or 
the strategy for its overall business;"
(vi) Current tax and deferred tax
Judgement was required to determine  
the total provision for current, deferred and 
other taxes due to uncertainties that exist with 
respect to the interpretation of the applicability 
of tax law at the time of the preparation of these 
financial statements.
Certain uncertainties exist with respect to 
the interpretation of tax regulations and the 
amount and timing of future taxable income. 
Differences arising between the actual results 
and the assumptions made, or future changes 
to such assumptions, could necessitate future 
adjustments to tax income and expense already 
recorded. Where the final tax outcome of such 
matters is different from the amounts that were 
initially recorded, such differences will impact 
the income and deferred tax amounts in the 
period in which the determination is made.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, based on the 
laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
(vii) Leases-Estimating the 
incremental borrowing rate
The Group cannot readily determine the 
interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it 
uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to 
measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of 
interest that the Group would have to pay to 
borrow over a similar term, and with a similar 
security, the funds necessary to obtain an 
asset of a similar value to the right-of-use 
asset in a similar economic environment. The 
IBR therefore reflects what the Group “would 
have to pay”, which requires estimation when 
no observable rates are available or when they 
need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and 
conditions of the lease. The Group estimates 
the IBR using observable inputs such as market 
interest rates when available and is required to 
make certain entity-specific estimates as well.
(viii) Revenue recognition from 
contracts with customers
Judgement is required in assessing  
the application of the principles of revenue 
recognition in respect of revenues. Certain 
contracts with customers are bundled 
packages that may include sale of products and 
telecommunications services that comprise 
voice, data, and other telecommunications 
services. The Group accounts for individual 
products and services separately as separate 
performance obligations if they are distinct 
promised goods and services. The Group 
exercises judgements in determining whether 
a product is distinct, that is, if such product or 
service is separately identifiable from other 
items in the bundled package and if  
a customer can benefit from it separately. 
This determination will affect the allocation 
of consideration specified in the contract and 
the revenue recognised for each performance 
obligation.
(ix) Assets held for sale
On 14 December 2021, the Group publicly 
announced the decision of its Board of 
Directors to sell SL T Campus (Pvt) Ltd., a wholly 
owned subsidiary. Operations of SL T Campus 
(Pvt) Ltd. are classified as a disposal group held 
for sale. The Board considered the subsidiary to 
meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale 
at that date for the following reasons: 
  SL T Campus (Pvt) Ltd. is available for 
immediate sale and can be sold to the buyer 
in its current condition
  The actions to complete the sale were 
initiated and expected to be completed 
within one year from the date of initial 
classification
  A potential buyer has been identified and 
negotiations as at the reporting date are at 
the conclusion stage.
  The shareholders approved the plan to 
sell on 14 December 2021. The Company 
disposed its 100% stake held in SL T Campus 
(Private) Limited on 25 January 2022.
(w) Amendments to existing 
accounting standards
The Group applied all the existing accounting 
standards up to 31 December 2022 in preparing 
these financial statements, which are effective 
for annual periods beginning on or after 
01 January 2022. The Group has not early 
adopted any other standard, interpretation or 
amendment that has been issued but is not  
yet effective.

(X) Standards issued  
but not yet effective
Definition of Accounting Estimates – 
Amendments to LKAS 8
The amendments clarify the distinction 
between changes in accounting estimates 
and changes in accounting policies and the 
correction of errors. Also, they clarify how 
entities use measurement techniques and 
inputs to develop accounting estimates. The 
amended standard clarifies that the effects on 
an accounting estimate of a change in an input 
or a change in a measurement technique are 
changes in accounting estimates if they do not 
result from the correction of prior period errors.
The amendments are effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
01 January 2023 and apply to changes in 
accounting policies and changes in accounting 
estimates that occur on or after the start of that 
period. Earlier application is permitted as long as 
this fact is disclosed.
The amendments are not expected to have 
a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements.
Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of 
Liabilities as Current or Non-current
Amendments to LKAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements specify the requirements 
for classifying liabilities as current or 
non-current. The amendments clarify;
  What is meant by a right to defer settlement
  That a right to defer must exist at the end of 
the reporting period
  That classification is unaffected by the 
likelihood that an entity will exercise its 
deferral right
  That only if an embedded derivative in 
a convertible liability is itself an equity 
instrument would the terms of a liability not 
impact its classification
  Disclosures
The amendments are effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
01 January 2023 and must be applied 
retrospectively. The Group is currently 
assessing the impact the amendments will have 
on current practice and whether existing loan 
agreements may require renegotiation.
Disclosure of Accounting Policies - 
Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice 
Statement 2
Amendments to LKAS 1 and IFRS Practice 
Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, 
provides guidance and examples to help entities 
apply materiality judgements to accounting 
policy disclosures. The amendments aim to help 
entities provide accounting policy disclosures 
that are more useful by:
Replacing the requirement for entities  
to disclose their “significant” accounting  
policies with a requirement to disclose  
their “material” accounting policies adding 
guidance on how entities apply the concept 
of materiality in making decisions about 
accounting policy disclosures.
The amendments are effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after  
01 January 2023.
The Group is currently revisiting the accounting 
policy information disclosures to ensure 
consistency with the amended requirements.
Deferred T ax related to Assets and 
Liabilities arising from a Single T ransaction – 
Amendments to IAS 12
The amendments clarify that where payments 
that settle a liability are deductible for tax 
purposes, it is a matter of judgement (having 
considered the applicable tax law) whether 
such deductions are attributable for tax 
purposes to the liability recognised in the 
financial statements (and interest expense) or 
to the related asset component (and interest 
expense). This judgement is important in 
determining whether any temporary differences 
exist on initial recognition of the asset and 
liability.
Also, under the amendments, the initial 
recognition exception does not apply to 
transactions that, on initial recognition, 
give rise to equal taxable and deductible 
temporary differences. It only applies if 
the recognition of a lease asset and lease 
liability (or decommissioning liability and 
decommissioning asset component) give rise 
to taxable and deductible temporary differences 
that are not equal.
The amendments are effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
01 January 2023.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of 
the amendments.
4. Financial Risk Management
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility 
for the establishment and oversight of the 
Group's risk management framework.
The Group's risk management processes are

The Audit Committee oversees how 
Management monitors compliance with the 
Group's risk management processes/guidelines

a well-established credit control policy and 
process to minimise the credit risk. Customers 
are categorised according to the segments 
and credit limit has been fixed as per their 
average monthly bill value. Customer usage and

from the employees EPF balance.
4.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will 
encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations 
associated with its financial liabilities that are 
settled by delivering cash or another financial 
asset. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that 
it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet 
its liabilities when due, under both normal 
and stressed conditions, without incurring 
unacceptable losses or risking damage to  
the Group’s reputation.
The Group ensures its liquidity is maintained 
by investing in short, medium and long-term 
financial instruments to support operational 
and other funding requirements. The Group 
determines its liquidity requirements by 
the use of both short and long-term cash 
forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented 
by a financial headroom analysis which is used 
to assess funding adequacy for at least a 
12-month period and the same is reviewed on 
an annual basis. 
Short and medium-term requirements  
are regularly reviewed and managed by the 
T reasury Division.

Financial Risk Management 
(Contd...)
4.3 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market 
prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest 
rates and equity prices which will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of 
financial instruments. The objective of market 
risk management is to manage and control 
market risk exposures within acceptable 
parameters, while optimising the return.
4.3.1 Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on 
services provided, services received and 
borrowings that are denominated in a currency 
other than the Sri Lankan rupees (LKR).
The Group manages its currency risk by a 
natural hedging mechanism to a certain  
extent by matching currency outflows for 
repayments of foreign currency loans and 
services with currency inflows for services 
settled in foreign currencies.
Further , SL T uses forward bookings to mitigate 
their foreign currency exposure in a prudent 
manner .

4.3.2 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk mainly arises as a result of 
Group having interest sensitive assets and 
liabilities, which are directly, impacted by 
changes in the interest rates. The Group’s 
borrowings and investments are maintained 
in a mix of fixed and variable interest rate 
instruments and periodical maturity gap 
analysis is carried out to take timely action and 
to mitigate possible adverse impact due to 
volatility of the interest rates.
T o minimise the adverse impact of variable 
interest rate borrowings due to an upward 
movement of USD interest rates in the market, 
the Company has obtained an interest rate 
SWAP and arrangements are being made to 
obtain an interest rate CAP .
Short-term interest rate management is 
delegated to the treasury operations while 
long-term interest rate management decisions 
require approval from the Board of Directors.
Interest rate sensitivity of the Company 
was computed within the floor interest rate 
(minimum) of 2.5% as stipulated in the loan 
agreement. The Group interest rate sensitivity 
was computed based on a 100 basis point 
increase or decrease. This analysis assumes 
that all other variables, in particular , foreign 
currency exchange rates, remain constant.  
The sensitivity of interest rate movement is 
shown below;
4.4 Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong  
capital base so as to maintain investor ,  
creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. Capital 
consists of stated capital and reserves The 
Board of Directors monitors the return on 
capital as well as the level of dividends to 
ordinary shareholders.
The Group’s objectives when managing 
capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital 
structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital 
structure, the Group may adjust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to 
reduce debt.

5. Operating Segments
The Group has three reportable segments, as 
described below, which are the Group's strategic 
divisions. The strategic divisions offer different 
products and services, and are managed 
separately because they require different 
technology and marketing strategies for each 
of the strategic divisions, the Board of Directors, 
(the Chief Operating Decision Maker-CODM) 
reviews internal management reports on at 
least quarterly basis. The following summary 
describes the operations in each of the Group's 
reportable segments.
  Fixed ICT operations includes supply of fixed 
telecommunication services.
  Mobile ICT operations includes supply of 
Mobile telecommunication services.
  Other segment operations includes 
directory publication and support services. 
None of these segments meet the 
quantitative thresholds for determining 
reportable segments in 2022 or 2021.
Information regarding the results of each 
reportable segment is included below. 
Performance is measured based on segment 
profit before tax. As included in the internal 
management reports that are reviewed by  
the Board of Directors (BOD). Segment profit is 
used to measure performance as Management 
believes that such information is the most 
relevant in evaluating the results of certain 
segments relative to other entities that operate 
within these industries.

are presented in a method consistent with 
the Management reporting provided to those

15. Intangible assets – Group (Contd...)
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s Cash-Generating Units (CGUs). A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below:
2022 2021
Mobitel (Private) Limited 141 141
eChannelling PLC 410 410
T otal 551 551
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections, based on 
financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the estimated 
growth rates stated below. The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates.
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are as follows:
2022
(%)
2021
(%)
Growth rate 8.0 8.7
Discount rate 18 16
Management determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development. The weighted average growth 
rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports. The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the 
relevant operating segments. No impairment charge has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2022 for the above CGU (2021 – LKR Nil).
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on fair value using level 1 observable inputs market share of eChannelling PLC. The management 
has observed that the current market price of a share of eChannelling PLC is more than a cost of a share as at 31 December 2022.

2021
%
Discount rate (long-term) 18.2 – 18.0 10.6-11.6 18.0 10.6

Retirement age of the employees – Years 55 – 60 55-60 55-60 55-60
In addition to above, demographic assumptions 
such as mortality, withdrawal, retirement age 
were considered for the actuarial valuation. In 
2022, 1967/70 Mortality T able issued by the 
Institute of Actuaries London (2021 – 1967/70 
Mortality T able) was taken as the base for 
the valuation.
The provisions for defined obligations of 
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, SL T Digital services 
(Private) Limited, Sri Lanka Telecom (Services) 
Limited, SL T Campus (Private) Limited, SL T 
VisionCom (Private) Limited, T alent fort  
(Private) Limited and Mobitel (Private)  
Limited, are actuarially valued by Messrs. 
Actuarial and Management Consultants 
(Private) Limited and Messrs. Piyal S 
Goonetilleke and Associates respectively.  
The provision for defined benefit obligations is 
not externally funded.
Sensitivity analysis
Reasonably possible changes at the 
reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial 
assumptions, holding other assumptions 
constant, would have affected the defined 
benefit obligation by the amount shown below.

method and assumption was used to estimate 
the fair values:
Cash and bank balances, short-term deposits, 
trade receivables, trade payables (current) 
and bank overdraft approximate their carrying 
amounts lastly due to the short term maturities 
of these investments.
Fair value of trade and other payables and 
borrowings have been arrived by discounting 
gross values by the year end AWFDR rate.

Fair value of financial assets and 
liabilities not carried at fair value
The following describes the methodologies 
and assumptions used to determine fair values 
of those financial instruments which are not 
already recorded at fair value in the Financial 
Statements.
Assets for which fair value 
approximates carrying value
Financial Assets and Liabilities that have a short 
term maturity, it is assumed that the carrying 
amounts approximate their fair values.
Fixed rate financial instruments
The fair value of fixed rate financial assets 
and liabilities carried at amortised cost are 
estimated by comparing market interest rates 
when they were first recognised with current 
market rates for similar financial instruments.
Variable rate financial instruments
Variable rate is a fair measure which  
reflects market movements. Hence the  
carrying value represents the fair value of  
the variable rate instruments.
37. Disclosure on Current 
Economic Situation in  
Sri Lanka
Significant unusual items affecting 
assets, liabilities, equity, net income or 
cash flows 
The telecommunication service has been 
categorised as an essential service by the 
Government of Sri Lanka. With the responsibility 
to provide an uninterrupted service to the 
nation, SL T as the national telecommunication 
service provider , activated its Business 
Continuity Plan (“BCP”) and implemented 
changes in operations, supply chain, workforce 
movements, investments and strategies to 
cope with the unprecedented challenges posed 
by the post-COVID-19 economic situation in 
the country. 
The below summarises our strategy and 
the response plan for the post-COVID-19 
economic situation in the country:
(a) Direction of operations
SL T together with its mobile arm Mobitel 
provided network assurance and uninterrupted 
business operations despite of the prevailed 
energy and fuel crisis. The Group experienced 
a positive impact in revenue in areas such as 
carrier business services and International 
business with the exchange rate movements 
and continuous network expansions. Further , 
future opportunities are emerging with novel 
digital products and services with digital 
transformation.
(b) Liquidity management
The effective collection strategies of the Group 
coupled with the need for continuous supply 
of telecommunication services improved 
collections over the period. However , as a result 
of recent utility price hikes and increase of 
individual income tax rates, disposable income 
of SL T customers has deteriorated significantly. 
This will affect the monthly collection and 
finally end up with further liquidity shortage. 
The group prioritised capital expenditure for 
critical projects, including projects which provide 
connectivity to rural areas to narrow the digital 
divide in the country. The sudden depreciation 
of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar 
during the year adversely impacted the cash 
flows of the group. Although, the foreign 
currency liquidity improved slightly in the latter 
part of the year , the domestic foreign exchange 
market posed challenges to project payments in 
foreign currency. Further , the liquidity shortage 
in LKR market and high inflation has pushed 
the market interest rates higher increasing 
financing costs of the group during the year .
(c) Impact on property,  
plant and equipment
The Group has assessed the impact on 
property, plant and equipment and spectrum 
assigned to the Group. The Group will continue 
to take proactive measures to mitigate 
any potential impact and will continue its 
contingency plans and risk management 
measures as the situation evolves.
 There were no other events or transactions 
that require disclosures or adjustments to  
the financial statements for the year ended  
31 December 2022.

In today’s interconnected world, reliability 
and security of the networks that undergird 
all digital and ICT functions, are paramount. 
Recognising the critical role of our network, 
we have incorporated comprehensive 
security like enabling an intelligent 
Automatically Switched Optical Network 
(ASON), and providing a 1+2 redundancy 
system to ensure reliable operation.
Meeting Future Connectivity 
Needs
The world is constantly evolving, and as 
Sri Lanka embraces new technologies like 
artificial intelligence, Internet of Things 
(IoT), cloud computing, and upgrades 
to wireless cellular technology such as 
5G, the need for robust, high-speed 
connectivity becomes critical. As a National 
digital enabler , SL T is geared to embrace 
opportunities and meet the varying needs 
of a rapidly changing environment.
SL T connects Sri Lanka to the world through 
five international submarine cable systems: 
SEA-ME-WE 3, SEA-ME-WE 4, SEA-ME-
WE5, Bharat Lanka, and Dhiraagu-SL T . As 
the globalised work environment expands 
and service exports become a key driver of 
Sri Lanka’s digital economy, we are outfitting 
our networks and infrastructure to meet 
the foreseen rise in communication and 
data needs. The potential for growth in the 
horizon is contingent upon the activation 
of capacity following the completion of 
the expansion of SEA-ME-WE 5. Similarly, 
a recent upgrade of SEA-ME-WE 4, with a 
capacity increase from 65Tb /s to 122Tb /s, 
positions the cable system to cater to 
increasing bandwidth demands.
8 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 
Driving a Smarter Sri Lanka
The upcoming SEA-ME-WE 6 cable, slated 
for completion in 2025, has a planned 
landing point at SL T’s Matara Cable Landing 
Station. This high-capacity network has a 
design capacity of 10x13 Tbps, of which 
SL T has secured a capacity of 6 Tbps – 
promising high-speed global connectivity 
and capacity for Sri Lanka’s consumers, 
enterprises, and the economy in the years 
to come. T ogether with SL T’s bolstered 
international backhaul capacity, this global 
platform creates a robust international 
backbone, ensuring reliable and efficient 
data flow for Sri Lanka’s digitalisation 
ambitions and roll-out of new technologies 
such as 5G.
SL T’s network of state-of-the-art data 
centres and multi-cloud offerings will be 
crucial to enabling and meeting the rising 
demand for digital services across the 
Country. We will continue to partner with 
investors and others to pursue set-up of 
additional data centres and installation of 
additional capacity at our existing locations.
We employ proactive capacity planning 
by analysing historical data and actively 
aligning with government and regulator 
initiatives such as “Connect Sri Lanka” , 
which sought to fulfil country-wide 4G 
and fibre broadband coverage. Following 
directives to phase out 3G and aggressively 
expand 4G coverage, we have continually 
expanded our capacity to match the 
direction of local demand. Where possible, 
we leverage Network Function Virtualization 
(NFVI) infrastructure to provide seamless 
integration without requirement for 
additional hardware. 
 Emerging T echnology and 
Opportunities
Emergence of 5G technology marks 
a revolutionary leap in connectivity. 
Its potential goes beyond faster data 
transfer to a world of applications that 
could transform the way we live, work, 
and interact. With auction of Sri Lanka’s 
5G spectrum on the horizon, SL T has 
embarked on pre-commercial trials of 
5G on a trial license. Pilot projects were 
rolled out across five cities: Colombo, 
Kandy, Galle, Anuradhapura, and 
Jaffna. Enhanced mobile broadband 
and ultra-reliable low latency 
communications (URLLC) have already 
lent themselves to innovative pilot 
ventures, and our teams are preparing 
to explore potential opportunities for 
systemic change through a variety of 
5G applications.

Group Chairman’ s Review
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am 
pleased to present Sri Lanka T elecom PLC’s 
Annual Report for 2023. The year presented 
a complex operating environment, as the 
cumulative effects of economic stressors 
from current and previous years bore down 
on the industry, economy, and customers. 
Macroeconomic challenges facing the 
telecommunication industry impacted 
both demand and supply sides, pressuring 
the Group’s topline and bottom line. 
Further , increase in taxation and electricity 
tariffs had a significant adverse impact on 
industry profitability.
Subdued Group Performance
SL T group reported a Loss After T ax of 
LKR 3.9 Bn. as the Group experienced 
marginal revenue degrowth in the single 
digits. SL T recorded a loss of LKR 1.1 Bn,  
and Mobitel a loss of LKR 3.6 Bn. SL T’s 
operations recorded a growth in revenue of 
3.2% during the year , while Mobitel recorded 
a reduction in revenue of 5.7% Y oY .
A T ransparent Review of 
Internal Challenges
While the ongoing economic crisis 
has undoubtedly impacted the entire 
telecommunications sector , some 
operators in the industry have navigated 
these challenges more effectively, achieving 
growth during this period. At the same time, 
despite long-standing structural challenges, 
the Group had managed to post profits 
and declare dividends in the previous years. 
Therefore, it is important to acknowledge 
that areas for improvement exist within 
the Group. These include enhancing 
productivity, optimising operating costs to 
be on par with industry peers, improving 
structures and processes, and addressing 
potential leakages. It is also vital that we 
identify, analyse, and address the factors 
that contributed to the Group’s loss during 
the year 2023.
Historically, two factors have contributed 
to the Group’s performance: Firstly, 
Mobitel was efficient and contributed a 
significant portion of Group profits until 
2021. Secondly, until recently, SL T had 
relied on sunken copper investments 
and therefore there was minimal capital 
investment on newer technologies like fibre 
network infrastructure including last-mile 
connections. While the copper network was 
inefficient, it generated sufficient revenue 
to cover costs in the past.
While these factors had contributed to 
creating a fragile profit for the Group  
in the past; a number of decisions  
taken in 2020 and thereafter ,  
compounded by a series of untimely 
occurrences, eroded the Group’s  
profit and contributed to the losses 
reported in 2023.
Recognising the challenges ahead, we are  
determined to overcome them through  
decisive action: to improve performance,  
ensure sustainability of the enterprise,  
and create long-term value.

 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 15
IntroductionExecutive StatementsBusiness Context and 
Strategy
BusinessEnvironmentSocialGovernanceFinancial ReportsSupplementary 
Information
The Group’s T echnical Sub-Committee 
(TSC) and Audit Committee (AC) have 
diligently assessed the decisions and issues 
that led to losses experienced during the 
year , and set a course to correct them, 
which I will outline herewith.
1. Deficiencies in capital  
project execution:
A review by the TSC revealed significant 
shortcomings in the execution of key capital 
expenditure projects, including Fibre- T o-
The-Home (FTTH), Fixed Wireless Access 
(FWA), Internet-Protocol- T elevision (IPTV) 
and Internet-Data-Centre (IDC). These 
projects suffered from cost overruns 
significantly exceeding initial projections; 
risks were not adequately assessed or 
factored into planning; excessive upfront 
capital expenditure was made without clear 
long-term return on investment strategies 
in place; and business cases relied on overly 
optimistic T erminal Value (TV) calculations 
to justify project returns - potentially 
inflating their viability.
These issues highlight the need for a more 
rigorous project management and risk 
assessment framework. The Group has 
taken steps to address these concerns: the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
and Remuneration Committee of the Board 
assisted the CEO to create a new General 
Manager position, reporting to the CEO, 
whose primarily responsibility is to ensure 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). The 
Group has also recruited suitable cadre, 
with international exposure, to fill the 
position. The Board has further designated 
the CEO and CFO as persons accountable 
for ensuring proper project appraisals, 
adherence to approved business cases, and 
regular proactive monitoring to keep the 
Board appraised.
2. Challenges with the Convergent 
Billing Project:
The TSC also identified issues with the 
Group’s single-sourced, technical-led, 
Convergent Billing project. This project was 
intended to streamline billing for bundled 
services. Often considered a Business 
Support System T ransformation project in 
the industry, such a project is considered a 
strategic undertaking that has the potential 
to transform every part of the business and 
deliver value to customers and internal and 
external stakeholders. 
However , TSC review has highlighted 
improper planning and deviation from 
industry best practices, which typically 
follow open tender processes and prioritise 
business needs. This has resulted in the 
Board recognising the project as high-risk. 
The Board is therefore actively monitoring 
the project.
3. Elevated costs through lack of 
CPE interoperability:
The AC and Senior T ender Board (STB) 
identified a lack of interoperability between 
Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) 
used for FTTH, which resulted in exorbitant 
prices. In order to address this, the AC and 
STB directed management to address 
the issue, thereby fostering greater 
competition among CPE vendors. This 
initiative successfully reduced CPE costs by 
approximately 50%.
4. Cash flow challenges due to 
funding mismatch and dependence 
on post-paid
The Group’s prior practice of financing 
long-term projects through short-term 
borrowings, has resulted in cash flow issues. 
In addition, an over-reliance on post-paid 
customer billing cycles has slowed down 
cash flow. 
Additionally, the prior practice of capitalising 
customer-specific connection costs (last-
mile infrastructure) enabled recording of 
growth in terms of revenues and profits. 
Albeit, this practice placed a tremendous 
burden on cash flows, increased borrowings, 
and caused enormous churn where net 
growth of customers was severely affected.
5. Mobitel’ s profitability erosion 
and subscriber churn:
Mobitel’s historical contribution to SL T 
through dividends ceased in FY2022 and 
FY2023, coinciding with a significant decline 
in profitability. Profits of LKR 8 Bn. in 2021 
turned into losses of LKR 120 Mn. in 2022 
and LKR 3.7 Bn. in 2023. This deterioration 
was primarily driven by a customer base 
reduction exceeding 1.3 million over the 
same period. An investigative audit directed 
by the AC identified several causal factors 
for the excessive and unprecedented levels 
of churn contributing to the rapid subscriber 
base decline, which fell from 8.5 million to 
7.2 million between 2022 and 2023.
Provision of defective Subscriber Identity 
Modules (SIM) batches by an identified 
supplier caused customer inconvenience, 
resulting in further churn and /or 
necessitating free SIM replacements at 
appreciable inconvenience to customers 
and increased overheads to Mobitel. As part 
of corrective action, Mobitel has ceased 
sourcing from this supplier and is pursuing 
necessary legal action.
Excessive T rade Incentives for customer 
acquisition significantly increased the 
Subscriber Acquisition Cost (SAC),  
which more than doubled compared 
to the previous year . This strategy, 
potentially driven by the need to 
replace defective SIMs, incentivised 
gross additions even through sale of 
new connections existing customers, 
further contributing to churn rates.
T aking immediate action to address these 
issues, from mid-2023 onward Mobitel 
implemented corrective measures in the 
trade incentive scheme that had severely 
burdened the company. In addition, the 
Board decided to not renew the Group 
Chief Executive Officer contract and to 
accept resignation of the Chief Executive 
Officer of Mobitel. Accordingly, the 
Board facilitated a merged-organisation 
structure for the Group with a single Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) – appointing 
Mr . Janaka Abeysinghe to this position to 
lead the unified organisation. As part of 
the merged structure, Mobitel welcomed 
Mr . Sudharshana Geeganage as its new 
Chief Operating Officer (COO).
Marking a T urning Point in 
2023: A Y ear of Restructure
T o navigate the ongoing challenges and 
ensure long-term success of the Group, 
the Board has focused on remedying urgent 
issues, addressing inefficiencies, optimising 
capital expenditure, and streamlining 
operations, as outlined above.
The significant concerns faced by the 
Group in 2023 also necessitated strategic 
course-correction and restructuring. In 
order to drive this shift, in January 2024, the 
Secretary to the T reasury replaced the six 
nominee Directors appointed on behalf of 
the Government of Sri Lanka. I am grateful 
to the Ministry of Finance and the Board of 
Sri Lanka T elecom PLC for placing their trust 
in me to take the helm as Chairman.

Group Chairman’s Review
16 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 
Looking to 2024: A Y ear for 
Refocus and Consolidation
Embarking on this journey of 
transformation, we are committed to 
creating a more efficient, agile, and 
cost-effective organisation, which is well-
positioned for future growth.
Following a comprehensive review by the 
Audit Committee, including benchmarking 
against regional best practices for multi-
company governance, the Board adopted 
a strategic initiative to consolidate 
and streamline the Group structure. 
This involved establishing effective 
governance frameworks for all privately held 
subsidiaries, ensuring clear accountability 
and performance measurement. The 
streamlined structure was implemented 
in a phased approach and became fully 
operational in March 2024.
Optimising our operations, we are working 
to maximise efficiency across the Group. 
While staff cost-to-revenue ratios are 
currently higher than the industry average, 
the Board is committed to achieving 
sustainable and profitable growth while 
optimising operations to improve these 
metrics. A key element in this endeavour 
is fostering a vibrant performance culture 
across the Group. We are looking to our 
staff to provide exceptional customer 
experiences as a core focus, and will be 
creating necessary structures to enable 
performing staff to reap the benefits. T o 
drive this cultural transformation, the Board, 
with the support of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee and Remuneration 
Committee, has appointed a new 
Chief People Officer with international 
experience. This dedicated leader will be 
responsible for implementing strategies 
to enhance staff productivity and build a 
culture of excellence across SL T .
We are also pleased to announce successful 
conclusion of litigation related to the 
Dialog-Airtel merger and Radio Access 
Network (RAN) sharing. This outcome 
was achieved through an equitable 
settlement agreement facilitated by 
the T elecommunications Regulatory 
Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL). We 
commend TRCSL ’s commitment to fairness 
and a just resolution for all parties involved. 
As a result of this agreement, Mobitel is 
expected to receive significant spectrum 
allocations from TRCSL. This includes 
5MHz of additional Frequency Division 
Duplexing (FDD) spectrum in the sub-1GHz 
low band, and 25MHz of Time Division 
Duplexing (TDD) spectrum in the 2.3GHz 
mid band. This additional spectrum will 
empower Mobitel to deliver an enhanced 
data experience for its customers and 
contribute to Sri Lanka’s digitalisation 
aspirations. Furthermore, the agreement 
addresses the long-standing issue of non-
contiguous spectrum allocation, leading 
to improved spectral efficiency and cost 
savings for Mobitel’s wireless business. 
The agreement also includes TRCSL ’s 
commitment to facilitate RAN sharing within 
the industry. This would unlock potential 
savings on infrastructure investments that 
will lessen the strain on foreign currency 
reserves and benefit the Group overall. 
This move will also allow for better network 
utilisation and increased capacity, ultimately 
benefiting customers through reduced 
costs and enhanced customer experience. 
Conclusion
In closing, I extend my gratitude to the 
former Board Directors who urgently 
and effectively addressed the challenges 
faced by the Group in 2023. I would also 
like to recognise the untiring efforts of our 
dedicated employees who went above and 
beyond in enabling the Group to withstand 
difficult circumstances. I also thank our 
shareholders, esteemed partners, and 
other stakeholders for their unwavering 
commitment and support. We recognise 
the challenges ahead, but I would like to 
reassure you that we are determined to 
overcome them. We are taking decisive 
action to improve performance, ensure 
sustainability of our enterprise, and create 
long-term value for our stakeholders. We 
appreciate your continued support as we 
continue to serve our country and people 
for a better and brighter future. 
A K D D D Arandara
Group Chairman
Despite challenges, I am immensely  
proud of the resilience demonstrated  
by the entire team at SL T .
Chief Executive Officer’ s Review
As we reflect on 2023 where countries and 
industries continued to face the pressures 
of a global slowdown, Sri Lanka’s economic 
contraction was felt by all our stakeholders. 
The telecommunications sector had to 
contend with a multitude of challenges 
including rising costs, while responding to 
the needs of customers. These factors, 
combined with rising exchange and 
interest rates, created a complex business 
environment that impacted our operations 
and results.
Despite these headwinds, I am immensely 
proud of the resilience demonstrated by 
the entire team at SL T . From the technical 
staff maintaining and extending critical 
infrastructure, to our customer experience 
teams, we have remained committed to 
delivering an exceptional service to our 
customers.
Navigating headwinds
Escalating costs, particularly the high 
increases in electricity tariffs in 2022 
and again in 2023, coupled with a steep 
escalation in exchange rate significantly 
impacted our business. As a leading digital 
enabler for the nation, high energy cost and 
Annual Maintenance Costs (AMC) involved 
in managing and sustaining vital network 
infrastructure was a major issue to contend 
with, as we continued to build out our 
network, align with connectivity needs of 
customers, and pursue the roll-out of new 
and more advanced technologies.
These factors were compounded by 
the prevalent elevated interest rates 
and inflationary pressures on consumer 
disposable income, which led to a  
higher customer churn-rate  
compared to previous years.  
While we saw a revenue increase of 3.2% 
Y oY , operational costs rose by 6%. This 
resulted in a Group-level loss, with SL T 
incurring a loss of LKR 1.1 Bn. and Mobitel 
a loss of LKR 3.6 Bn. The Group Earnings 
Before Interest, T axes, Depreciation, and 
Amortisation (EBITDA) also reflects these 
challenges.
Cost optimisation was a central focus 
during the year as we successfully managed 
internal costs where possible by maximising 
efficiencies and absorbing costs by adjusting 
the focus of our teams to include certain 
maintenance activities. While external 
factors like license fees, interest rates and 
energy prices remained beyond our direct 
control, consolidation of Annual Maintenance 
Costs (AMC), and continuing investment in 
profitable and revenue generating projects 
contributed to cost-effectiveness and  
cost-benefits that we could extend to  
our customers.
Investing in our employees
The economic environment of  
the last two years brought multiple  
stressors for human resource  
management and talent  
retention for all Sri Lankan  
institutions. Combatting  
talent-flight across various  
professions, we implemented  
proactive initiatives to  

Chief Executive Officer’s Review
18 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 
reinforce SL T’s employee value proposition 
and ultimately attract, retain, and groom 
suitable personnel. These measures 
prioritised review of policies, enriching the 
organisational culture and work experience, 
and strengthening career advancement 
pathways. Our commitment extended to 
leadership development, with the launch of 
SL T’s Executive Development Programme 
in 2023, investing in over 10,000 training 
hours and providing an immersive training 
experience over for 100 key executives.
Expanding our network  
and offering
While we remained committed to 
infrastructure investments to extend reach, 
better serve our customers, and position to 
meet Sri Lanka’s growing digitalisation needs, 
network expansion slowed down in 2023. 
Our investments ranged from development 
of approximately 1.2 million FTTH ports and 
deployment of over 400 new 4G L TE base 
stations, expanding both wired and wireless 
networks across the country. 
Supporting Sri Lanka’s economic recovery, 
we continued to extend reliable, secure, 
and innovative products and services to 
businesses while supporting the digitalisation 
efforts of enterprises, SMEs, and a number 
of government institutions. Our enterprise 
segment saw continued growth in 2023, led 
by noteworthy revenue growth from the SME 
segment, and growth from large enterprise 
business. In line with SL T’s strategy of driving 
a smarter Sri Lanka, and our continued focus 
on empowering Business Segments we 
debuted new cost-effective products and 
expanded our enterprise service offering. 
Recognising the challenges faced by our 
consumers in the aftermath of the economic 
crisis, we delivered a number of innovative 
products and options that increased 
flexibility, affordability, and convenience for a 
wide customer base.
SL T’s wholesale business continues 
to facilitate connectivity demands of 
domestic and international telcos. We 
have also invested in capacity increases 
at data centres and upgraded and 
expanded the wired and wireless network 
infrastructure to accommodate growing 
demand, strengthening our domestic and 
international transport offering.
Additionally, our international business 
and presence remains strong with Xyntac 
establishing a footprint overseas and 
focusing on emerging opportunities 
unlocked by our international cable 
infrastructure. We have invested in the 
SMW6 submarine cable, due to complete 
in 2025, securing capacity that will provide 
high-speed global connectivity for Sri Lanka’s 
consumers, enterprises, and economy in the 
years to come.
Subsidiaries play a vital role in SL T’s overall 
strategy. We continued to develop synergies 
across the Group, while improving standards 
and processes, increasing efficiency, and 
exploring options for consolidation and 
amalgamation. SL TS, our System Integration 
(SI) business, saw significant growth in 
the enterprise space, driven by our focus 
on digital transformation and buoyed 
by strong partnerships with banks and 
leading corporates. 
T ransforming our business 
through innovation and 
sustainability
The global telecommunications sector 
continues to evolve and adapt to 
technological advancements and changing 
consumer demands. On par with these 
trends, SL T’s digital and organisational 
transformation to a future-ready technology 
company is encapsulated in our strategy. 
In 2023, the Digital T ransformation Division 
continued our digitalisation efforts, 
prioritised internal process improvement, 
and bolstered our capabilities in software 
development, integration, and frontier 
technologies. These undertakings 
culminated in establishment of SL T’s 
dedicated Innovation Group in 2024, which 
includes an R&D lab, which is partnering with 
leading innovators and customers to pilot a 
range of internal and external initiatives.
Sustainability of our operations and 
long-term business model is a priority 
focus area that we strive to integrate 
into business practices. Exercising 
our commitment to environmental 
stewardship, we continued to pursue 
energy efficiency measures and expand 
our renewable energy generation. With 
solar systems now installed at 19 locations, 
and plans in place for solar PV at more than 
200 additional sites with a total capacity 
of 6MW, we expect annual savings of 
approximately LKR 260 Mn. and emissions 
reduction of around 6,300 tCO2e. This 
commitment extends to our office 
facilities, as we are proud to announce 
that the SL T -MOBITEL Operational HQ 
in Welikada was awarded a prestigious 
Platinum green building rating.
Looking to the future
Despite the challenges faced in 2023, we 
are resolutely optimistic about the future 
as Sri Lanka’s economy is expected to 
return to growth in 2024 and evolution 
in the technological landscape indicates 
SL T is well-positioned to lead the way. 
The expected 5G spectrum allocation 
presents a significant opportunity to unlock 
the transformative potential of this next-
generation 5G technology. We are confident 
our pre-commercial trial and pilot projects 
have equipped us with the knowledge and 
expertise to be a frontrunner in the 5G space, 
particularly for enterprise applications. 
Our robust partner ecosystem, including 
engagement of leading technological 
innovators, will allow us to capitalise on 
emerging opportunities. Meeting the needs 
of Sri Lanka’s evolving digital economy, we 
expect to be at the forefront of supporting 
and rolling out frontier technologies such as 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning 
(ML), Big Data analytics, Internet of Things 
(IoT), and Robotic Process Automation (RPA). 
The strength, reliability, and safety of our 
foundational network infrastructure, provision 
of cloud connectivity and edge computing 
solutions, leveraging of network APIs, and 
innovative SD-WAN enterprise solutions will 
pave the way for a more connected, intelligent, 
and automated future.

Operating Context
Analysing the operational landscape of 
Sri Lanka T elecom PLC (SL T), we delve 
into the global economic scenario, the 
international telecommunications and 
technological landscape, and the socio-
economic backdrop of Sri Lanka, coupled with 
anticipated growth in the upcoming year .
The Global Economy
“Global GDP growth is projected to stay 
at 3.1% in 2024 and rise to 3.2% in 2025. 
Elevated Central Bank rates to fight inflation 
and a withdrawal of fiscal support amidst 
high debt weigh on economic activity. 
Inflation is falling faster than expected in 
most regions, amid unwinding supply-side 
issues and restrictive monetary policy. 
Global headline inflation is expected to fall 
to 5.8% in 2024 to 4.4% in 2025, with the 
2025 forecast having been revised down.” , 
as stated by the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF).

Contrastingly, the World Bank presents 
a sombre outlook for 2024, envisioning 
a third consecutive year of global GDP 
deceleration to 2.4%. This trajectory 
poses a threat to poverty reduction goals, 
potentially hindering efforts to uplift 
vulnerable populations. 
As we approach the midpoint of a transformative decade, the global economy is on track to 
register the slowest half-decade of GDP growth in three decades, as reported by the World 
Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report.

The OECD’s latest Economic Outlook projects global GDP growth to reach a mild slowdown 
to 2.7% in 2024 and a slight improvement to 3.0% in 2025. Asia is expected to continue to 
account for the bulk of global growth in 2024 /25, as it has in 2023.
Impact of the Gaza Conflict 
The impact of the conflict on worldwide commodity markets has been relatively contained, 
witnessing only a modest uptick of around 6% in oil prices. The World Bank reports that 
agricultural commodities, the majority of metals, and other commodities have displayed 
minimal fluctuations.
However , the situation might swiftly take a turn for the worse if other Middle Eastern nations 
decide to engage in the conflict. The potential blockage of the Suez Canal alone could result 
in a substantial 12% reduction in global trade. According to the most pessimistic forecasts, 
the outbreak of a direct war involving additional regional countries might elevate global 
inflation by 1.2% and reduce world GDP by 1%.
Global T elecom Industry
Research conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute reveals that the global 
telecommunications sector holds a substantial value of USD 1.5 T n., contributing to 2.5% 
of the overall global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The study further indicates that this 
sector is experiencing a robust annual growth rate of 5%, surpassing the pace of the global 
economy, with even greater opportunities in the future.
“Driven largely by video traffic, global data consumption over telecom networks will nearly 
triple, from 3.4 Mn. petabytes (PB) in 2022 to 9.7 Mn. PB in 2027. As the transition to 5G 
continues, and newer technological standards gain traction, telcos are projected to invest 
USD 342.1 Bn. in their networks in 2027 alone” . These are among the key findings outlined in 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) first Global T elecom Outlook.

According to McKinsey Global, telcos 
could unlock growth and rejuvenation 
by wholeheartedly adopting extensive 
AI deployment and transitioning into 
organisations that are inherently AI-native. 
Recognising this imperative as non-
negotiable, some telcos are increasing their 
investments in AI, scaling them up as the 
tangible business impact of this technology 
becomes evident. 
Sri Lanka too can expect the 
implementation of such technologies in the 
near future, with SL T playing a crucial role in 
their rollout and adoption.
Sri Lankan Economy
Sri Lanka’s economy is expected to grow 
by 1.7% in 2024 after contracting by 
3.8% in 2023, the World Bank said in its 
twice-a-year update, in January this year . 
Several indicators point to the realisation of 
this optimistic scenario. 
Improved Forex Situation
In December 2023, Sri Lanka’s gross official 
reserves reached USD 4.4 Bn., as per official 
data. This increase was supported by loans 
from multilateral lenders, including the 
International Monetary Fund.

Data consumption associated with gaming 
is expected to rise at a 21% Compound 
Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) between 
2022 and 2027, reflecting the continued 
shift towards online and cloud gaming. 
The projected CAGR of around 43% in 
virtual reality (VR) data over the five-year 
time frame will see its share of total data 
consumption reach 5% by 2027, driven 
by the growth of the metaverse. However , 
incomes for telecoms will not improve 
proportionately due to the commoditised 
nature of data, which doesn’t allow for 
differentiating the offer . This holds true for 
telecom operators such as SL T as well.
Impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
on the Industry
The telecommunications industry stands 
at the epicentre of driving widespread 
adoption of advanced technologies, 
primarily propelled by mobile and 5G 
broadband services in the Internet of Things 
(IoT) era. Projections indicate that the global 
AI component in the telecommunications 
market is expected to reach USD 14.99 Bn. 
by 2027, up from USD 11.89 Bn. in 2020, 
with a remarkable CAGR of 42.6% during 
the period 2021-2027.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a pivotal 
role in this transformative journey, 
influencing various aspects such as: 
network optimisation, automation of 
customer service, integration of virtual 
assistants, predictive maintenance, 
implementation of Robotic Process 
24 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 
Operating Context
In 2023, remittances to Sri Lanka through 
official channels increased by 57% to 
USD 5.97 Bn., up from USD 3.8 Bn. the 
previous year . This rise was facilitated by a 
better exchange rate following improved 
monetary policy. This marks the highest 
annual inflow from Sri Lankan expatriates 
since 2019.
Sri Lanka’s tourism sector has experienced 
significant growth, with earnings exceeding 
USD 2 Bn. and the arrival of over 1.48 million 
visitors in 2023. This marks the highest 
revenue and visitor influx since 2019. 
Sri Lanka T ourism has set ambitious goals 
for 2024, aiming to attract 2.5 million 
tourists and generate USD 4.6 Bn. in 
revenue. Additionally, the long-term 
strategy aims to increase arrivals to 5 million 
and achieve revenue of USD 21.6 Bn. within 
five years.
Impact of VA T
Many import restrictions of the past 
few years have been lifted, and foreign 
exchange is readily accessible. While 
the exchange rate remains elevated, 
there is room for improvement in the 
importation of communication devices 
by individuals, corporates, as well as the 
telecommunications industry. However , 
the Government’s announcement of an 
increase in the value added tax (VA T) from 
15% to 18% has resulted in corresponding 
increments in taxes on Mobile, Mobile 
Broadband, Fixed Broadband, Pay 
T elevision, and value-added services. This 
adjustment has the potential to affect 
revenue, particularly from users of more 
premium services.
While the worst days of inflation are over , 
increase in the value added tax (VA T) and 
the resultant rise in overall costs could drive 
inflation up to about 7% by January 2024, 
from 4% in December 2023 and 3.4% in 
November 2023.
Future Prospects
In terms of industry outlook, the Sri Lanka 
telecommunications market revenue is 
expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8% over 
the next five years. Most of the major 
telecom companies in the world are 
present in the country, making significant 
R&D investments consistently. Key 
telecom operators have completed 5G 
demonstrations and trials. Customers will 
slowly migrate from 3G and 4G networks to 
the 5G network, once it is implemented.
The impending arrival of the 5th Generation 
of mobile networks heralds a connectivity 
revolution, poised to assume a more 
significant role than its predecessors. As 
per the Ministry of T elecommunication 
and Digital Infrastructure’s projections, 
the development of 5G technology alone 
has the potential to contribute up to 10% 
of Sri Lanka’s total GDP by 2025, and 
generate over one million jobs. It could 
augment Sri Lanka’s GDP from USD 8 Bn. to 
USD 20 Bn. by the year 2030.
The proposed merger between Dialog 
and Airtel would create a combined entity 
with a significant advantage in spectrum 
ownership. The combined holding would 
represent a higher portion of the total 
spectrum allocated in the mobile industry. 
Industry analysts point to spectrum 
ownership as a key factor determining 
product quality and overall competitiveness; 
indicating the merger could grant 
immediate subscriber growth and a 
potential service and network quality edge.
During the year , the Company achieved 
a significant milestone by introducing 
the innovative hybrid model (SA+NSA) 
technology of 5G for the first time in 
Sri Lanka. With the deployment of 5G 
Standalone, SL T is positioned to support 
essential applications requiring Ultra-
Reliable Low Latency Communication 
(URLLC) with enhanced latency, and 
enhance its capacity for Network Slicing, 
Robust Quality of Service (QoS) Assurance, 
Edge Computing, and various other cutting-
edge functionalities.
Under the leadership of SL T , which 
straddles the fixed line and mobile spheres, 
and is fully geared to take the country 
towards the future, this could be the 
transformative scenario that awaits the 
telecommunications industry, as well as 
the Sri Lankan economy. The Company’s 
diverse technological and human resources 
could pave the way for a revolution in 
telecommunications, reaping vast socio-
economic benefits for the nation.

Materiality
“Materiality” refers to the significance and relevance of matters that 
substantively affect an organisation’s ability to create value over the 
short, medium and long-term.
Materiality extends beyond financial considerations to encompass 
various factors, including aspects such as Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG). Determination of materiality involves an 
assessment of the impact an issue has on the organisation’s ability 
to create and preserve value over time. This assessment considers 
both quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial 
metrics, operational impacts, and stakeholder interests, in order to 
provide a balanced and comprehensive view of the organisation’s 
performance, risks, and opportunities. 
Sri Lanka T elecom PLC (SL T) employs a meticulous and 
comprehensive approach in determining material issues, employing 
rigorous criteria integral to portraying an accurate depiction of 
the Company’s operational landscape. Financial significance is 
methodically assessed through quantitative metrics, encompassing 
revenue streams, cost structures, and capital allocation, ensuring a 
precise evaluation of monetary impact on SL T’s financial standing. 
Operational impact analysis delves into key performance indicators 
(KPIs), operational efficiencies, and technological infrastructure 
considerations to gauge the ramifications on day-to-day activities.
Relevance to stakeholders involves a sophisticated stakeholder 
mapping, integrating customer feedback, investor expectations, 
employee concerns, and compliance with regulatory bodies. 
Moreover , SL T incorporates a legal and regulatory compliance 
framework, tracking changes in telecommunications regulations, 
and aligning its reporting with industry standards. 
SL T demonstrates robust adherence to internationally recognised 
ESG standards and frameworks. Committed to sustainable 
practices, SL T aligns its operations with recognised ESG 
benchmarks, fostering transparency and accountability. Relevant 
trends are analysed through competitive intelligence, and 
sustainability metrics are embedded to align the report with ESG 
benchmarks. 
This determined and purposeful synthesis of technical inputs 
ensures that the annual report not only meets industry standards 
but also serves as a robust tool for stakeholders to make 
informed assessments of SL T’s performance in the dynamic 
telecommunications sector .

Financial and Economic 
Backdrop
The year under review was a challenging 
one for the telecommunication industry 
in general amidst a turbulent macro-
economic environment in the country. 
Adverse impacts of the financial and 
economic crisis lingering from 2022 
continued to be felt in 2023. With the 
steep depreciation of the Rupee in 2022 
and soaring inflation, the industry had to 
cope with an unprecedented rise in costs. 
Customers were also severely affected with 
their purchasing power being squeezed. 
The industry suffered a double whammy 
with reduced revenue and increased 
costs. Electricity is a major component of 
the industry’s cost base; electricity costs 
increased more than double in several 
rounds of tariff escalations starting from 
2H2022. Another significant cost element, 
viz. network /IP and IT infrastructure 
maintenance costs, also increased by 
around 80-100%, due to depreciation of the 
Rupee and inflation. In addition, transport 
costs also increased significantly. This is 
attributable to the 200 - 300% increase in 
fuel costs, and the increase in hiring costs 
caused by the import ban on vehicles. While 
these cost elements increased many-
fold, revenues plummeted. Affordability 
of customers was severely affected by 
inflation on one hand and income tax rates 
doubling from 18% to 36% on the other . 
T elecommunication services, though 
important to customers, do not rank as high 
in their order of priorities as food, medicine 
or children’s education.
Consequently, the SL T Group reported a 
downturn in its results for the year under 
review, recording a marginal degrowth in 
revenue of 1.2% Y oY to LKR 106.4 Bn. and  
a loss after tax for the year of LKR 3.9 Bn. 
The total assets of the Group increased by 
2.5% Y oY to LKR 246.7 Bn. as at  
31 December 2023. 
Given below is a detailed analysis of how we 
nurtured our Financial Capital during the 
year under review, demonstrating resilience 
of the SL T Group to withstand challenging 
operating conditions.
Income Statement
Revenue
Group revenue decreased by 1.2% Y oY 
to LKR 106.4 Bn. in 2023 from LKR 107.7 
Bn. in 2022. SL T company recorded a 
growth in revenue of 3.2% during the 
year primarily driven by growth in revenue 
from broadband, IPTV and expansion of 
enterprise and carrier domestic business. 
Full year impact of the tariff increase in the 
latter half of 2022 also made a positive 
contribution to revenue from broadband 
and IPTV services. Mobitel recorded a 
degrowth in revenue of 5.7% primarily due 
to decrease in the subscriber base resulting 
from increased subscriber churn and issues 
relating to affordability of subscribers.

Earnings Before Interest, T axes, 
Depreciation and Amortisation 
(EBITDA)
Compounding impact of degrowth in 
Group revenue and increase in operating 
expenses, resulted in a drop in EBITDA by 
19.1% in 2023, compared to 2022. The 
SL T Group implemented several initiatives 
to manage escalating costs which led to 
a reduction in staff costs and advertising 
and activation costs along with repair and 
maintenance costs also decreasing during 
the latter part of the year . However , these 
savings were outweighed by the fall in the 
top line and an increase in other costs and 
depreciation, driving overall losses. As a 
result, EBITDA margin of the SL T Group 
decreased from 37.1% in 2022, to 30.4% 
in 2023. 
Fixed operations of the Group recorded 
an EBITDA of LKR 23.6 Bn. reflecting a 
decrease of 1.8% Y oY . EBITDA margin 
dropped marginally from 35.6% in 2022 to 
33.9% in 2023, driven by the increase in 
operating expenditure. EBITDA of mobile 
operations decreased by 47.7% to LKR 
8.8 Bn. causing the EBITDA margin to 
substantially reduce to 20.7% in 2023, from 
37.4% in 2022. This was due to the increase 
in electricity tariffs, impact of depreciation 
of the Rupee that increased expenses 
including annual maintenance costs and 
license fees, and repair and maintenance 
costs.

Managing Costs 
Several rounds of electricity tariff increases 
starting from second half of 2022 had 
a significant impact on the operating 
expenses. T ransport costs too recorded 
a substantial increase as a result of 
increased fuel prices and import ban on 
vehicles. These factors negated the savings 
from cost containment initiatives taken 
during the year , resulting in the Group’s 
operating costs increasing by 7.5%. Direct 
costs increased by 8.8%, primarily due to 
inflationary pressures, rising energy costs 
and increasing annual maintenance cost. 
The overall cost increase of 7.5% combined 
with the degrowth in revenue of 1.2%, 
caused operating profit to decline by 67.2%, 
and the operating profit margin to decline to 
3.9% in 2023, compared to 11.6% in 2022.

Profit Before and After T ax
The Group recorded a loss before tax 
of LKR 2.7 Bn. in 2023 compared to the 
profit of LKR 10.6 Bn. in 2022, a 125% 
decrease, due to the degrowth in revenue, 
the increase in operating expenses and the 
substantial increase in interest expense, 
which was partly offset by the foreign 
exchange gain compared to the foreign 
exchange loss in the previous year and the 
growth in other income. An income tax 
provision of LKR 1.3 Bn. for the year caused 
the loss after tax of the Group to increase 
to LKR 3.9 Bn. for the year compared 
to the profit after tax of LKR 4.8 Bn., a 
182.3% decrease. 
The Group’s fixed operations recorded a 
loss of LKR 1.1 Bn. in 2023 compared to the 
profit of LKR 8.5 Bn. in 2022 as a result of 
soaring interest expenses and escalating 
operating cost during the year . The Group’s 
mobile operations recorded a loss of  
LKR 3.7 Bn. mainly due to revenue degrowth 
and increased operating expenses.

The Group’s liquidity position in terms of 
short-term investments and cash and cash

at 31 December 2023 reflecting a decline 
of 31.1% compared to LKR 18.1 Bn. as at 
December 31, 2022. This was due to the 
utilisation of a portion of the liquid assets 
for funding strategic projects such as 
SEA-ME-WE 6 and FTTH. Other current 
assets amounted to 11.5% of the total 
current assets which included LKR 4.1 Bn.

Consequent to the loss incurred during

LKR 92.5 Bn as at the end of the 2022 and 
accounted for 35.9% of all funding sources

shortfall in funding for the growth in PPE 
and intangible assets over and above the 
amounts drawn down from short-term 
investments and cash and cash equivalents 
as detailed above, had to be secured 
from borrowings and vendor financing. 
Accordingly, total borrowings of the Group 
increased by 34.9% from LKR 47.3 Bn. as at 
31 December 2022 to LKR 63.8 Bn. as at  
31 December 2023. T rade payables

Cashflows
The net cash flows generated from 
operations decreased by 40.4% to 
LKR 17.2 Bn. The main contributory factors 
for the decrease were the substantial 
increase in interest payments due to 
increase in interest rates, the amount 
of new borrowings and a decrease in 
trade and other payables. The cash 
outflow on investing activities amounted 
to LKR 32.7 Bn. in 2023 compared to 
LKR 40.8 Bn. in 2022 due to prioritising of 
capital expenditure (capex) in high yielding, 
short payback period investments such as 
fibre project to improve revenue. Despite 
the increasing gearing levels, it is imperative 
that the Group continues to invest in new 
technologies and capacity enhancements 
to support the Nation’s increased 
dependency on telecommunication and 
digital products in every aspect of life. Net 
cash generated from financing activities 
recorded a substantial increase and 
amounted to LKR 13.1 Bn. comprising of 
borrowings from financial institutions of 
LKR 28.2 Bn. which was partly offset by an 
increase in loan repayments by LKR 5.4 Bn. 
during the year . 
Although there is a reduction during 
the year , the Group concluded the 
financial year with a favourable net 
cash and cash equivalents balance of 
LKR 5.1 Bn. compared to LKR 8.6 Bn. a year 
ago. Prudent management of financial 
resources and forex exposure helped 
the Group to record these results. The 
Group has sufficient liquid assets to meet 
its obligations and is poised for growth 
with enhanced value propositions for its 
stakeholders.

Looking to the Future
Given the need to invest in infrastructure on one hand and increasing level of gearing on 
the other , it is imperative that the Company exercises care and prioritise carefully when 
making capex investments, limiting it to essential enhancements. We intend to continue to 
concentrate on high return short-payback period investments. Some capex investments 
that are less urgent may have to be deferred to 2025 and 2026. A focus area will be the 
expansion of the fibre network, which will lead to increased revenues. Expansion of wireless 
will be a priority for Mobitel. Given the cost optimisation measures already implemented, 
large cost increases are not anticipated in 2024. Accordingly, we look forward to restore 
profitability in 2024, which will enable us to reward our stakeholders with substantial 
increments. We also plan to introduce new packages that will add value to our customers, 
which will enhance our profitability.

T o meet growing demand in an increasingly 
digitalised world, we are constantly 
investing in expanding, maintaining, and 
better managing our critical infrastructure. 
Our Network Operations and Facilities 
Management Divisions play a key role. 
While managing the comprehensive 
network operations of the Group, these 
divisions also spearhead new initiatives, 
pilot projects, ongoing network planning 
and maintenance, and customer 
service fulfilment.
Consolidation of our operations and 
services has enabled SL T to optimise 
day-to-day maintenance, investments, 
and deployments leading to considerable 
cost and time savings. Continuous 
capability development of our teams and 
introduction of performance indicators and 
incentives have further improved efficiency 
of our infrastructure management and 
maintenance.
During the year 2023, our infrastructure 
investments focused on expansion of 
the network, consolidation of the Group’s 
operational footprint, and investing in key 
projects that would enhance Sri Lanka’s 
global connectivity and create new avenues 
for advancement of digitalisation ambitions.
Fuelled by the surge in mobile broadband 
usage, which took off during the pandemic, 
and is intensified by Sri Lanka’s ongoing 
digital transformation; Mobitel prioritised its 
wireless network expansion for broadband 
throughout 2023. Mobitel invested over 
LKR 13.4 billion during the year for wireless 
network expansion.
This addressed the growing demand for 
high-speed data and focused on enhancing 
customer experience. Network upgrades 
over 530 sites significantly enhanced 
4G capacity, resulting in a 40% traffic 
increase during the year . Further , Mobitel

Intellectual Resources
Brand Unification and  
Brand Building 
The integration of SL T and Mobitel 
operations leading to organisational 
alignment and the rebranding of the 
unified entity as “SL T - MOBITEL ” , has been 
strengthened by combining the positive 
reputation of both entities into a single, 
strong brand focused on digitalisation. This 
was a process which commenced in 2021, 
and has now reached fruition. This has been 
a journey and a learning process the full 
benefits of which were reaped in 2023.
From an organisational standpoint, the 
merger has led to vastly improved financial 
resources, operational efficiencies, cost 
reductions, and enhanced investments in 
infrastructure and innovation. Despite many 
challenges stemming from the operating 
environment, SL T -MOBITEL has maintained 
its Brand Equity Index – Fixed broadband 
in the 70+ range. The Brand Equity 
Index – Fixed line has held its position as the 
leader in this category.
This has delivered significant benefits 
including convenience and cost savings 
for individual consumers through bundled 
service offerings and streamlined billing 
processes. They can now enjoy innovative 
products and services incorporating the 
latest technologies, improved service 
quality, expanded coverage, and enhanced 
brand experience, resulting in increased 
satisfaction and loyalty. Corporate and SME 
customers now benefit from integrated 
communication solutions, fostering 
efficiency and productivity. 
T owards becoming  
a T ech Company
With a broader service portfolio and 
enhanced capabilities, we are now better 
positioned to innovate, invest in advanced 
technologies, and compete effectively in 
the dynamic telecommunications market, 
ultimately delivering greater value to 
customers and stakeholders. Following 
this successful unification, we have begun 
gradually transitioning from T elco towards 
more techco-oriented solutions to meet 
the demands of all stakeholders. 
T elecommunication companies now face 
competition from tech giants such as 
Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), 
and Facebook, media conglomerates, and 
start-ups, compelling them to redefine their 
roles in the market. This journey from T elco 
to T echco involves embracing personalised 
services, digitalisation, innovation, 
and diversification, all underpinned by 
seamless connectivity. The journey from 
T elco to T echco is not a mere change of 
services; it is a strategic imperative for 
telecommunications companies to ensure 
their survival and thrive in the digital era. 
This transformative path offers multiple 
benefits: including a robust competitive 
edge and diversified revenue streams. SL T’s 
Digital T ransformation programme takes a 
structured approach to achieve the T echco 
transformation within the company.
One of the key strengths of SL T lies in 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for which we have 
embarked on projects where we deployed 
Extract T ransform and Load (ETL) to extract 
information from multiple data sources. 
The completion of this project in November 
2023 signifies a significant milestone in 
enhancing data management capabilities. 
In addition, we are in the process of 
upgrading one of the key projects of SL T , 
a billing consolidation project. This would 
upgrade the existing systems of retail billing, 
interconnect billing and the mediation 
system to the latest version.
Operating Licence
In a highly competitive, albeit highly 
regulated, industry SL T continued to be 
in the forefront as the licensed National 
Information and Communications 
T echnology solutions provider of 
Sri Lanka. SL T obtained the license 
from T elecommunications Regulatory 
Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL), which 
was renewed in 2023. With the unification 
of the two companies unified licensing 
is expected on finalising of the process 
by TRCSL. The financial statements give 
the value of the operating licenses as 
LKR 1.6 Bn. and LKR 1.44 Bn. for SL T and 
Mobitel respectively. However , the intrinsic 
relative value of the two licenses is much 
more heavily weighted towards SL T Group. 
Licenses held by the SL T Group;
 • Fixed Operator License issued by TRCSL
 •  Mobile Operator License issued by 
TRCSL
 •  Broadcasting License to provide Internet 
Protocol T elevision (IPTV) service issued 
by Ministry of Mass Media
 •  Direct to Home (DTH) Satellite 
Broadcasting License issued by TRCSL
 •  Satellite T elevision Broadcasting License 
issued by Ministry of Mass Media
 •  License for Spectrum issued by TRCSL
 •  Vendor License issued by TRCSL
Spearheading Innovation
We have innovatively developed numerous 
IoT applications. These applications are 
actively marketed to customers through the 
enterprise route. Additionally, our portfolio 
includes the successful delivery of a 
call-centre solution, a queue management 
solution, and workflow solutions. Notably, 
our call centre solution is currently 
operational at prominent organisations 
such as the Ceylon Electricity Board, 
National Water Supplies and Drainage 
Board, and the Sri Lanka Insurance 
Corporation Limited.
We have identified specific processes 
for simplification and modernisation, as 
part of a Group-wide initiative to enhance 
operational efficiency. Notably, our 
strides in digitalisation have propelled us 
to a paperless operation, surpassing the 
75% mark. This encompasses the digital 
management of documents through 
our Document Management System 
(DMS) and the handling of Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) digitally. These 
advancements mark a significant transition 
towards streamlined and contemporary 
operational practices.
In a landmark event, SL T has launched 
its long-awaited VMWare Double Cloud 
Service, VCL. This is an innovative step 
that has made SL T a key player in the cloud 
revolution. This introduces a dual cloud 
architecture that leverages the features of 
two cloud environments.

Consolidation of  
Data Centres 
In response to the increased costs 
stemming from currency devaluation,  
we are implementing measures to reduce 
overall expenses. One significant step 
involves consolidating the data resources 
of SL T and Mobitel in the data centre. 
This strategic move aims to minimise our 
footprint and concurrently achieve cost 
reductions.
Measuring Our Digital 
Maturity
We carried out a comprehensive analysis 
of the current status (AS-IS Study) of 
our Company based on the TMForum’s 
(T ele-Management Forum) Digital Maturity 
Model (DMM) to ascertain the current digital 
maturity level of the Organisation. This 
study was done assessing the organisation 
under six main dimensions – Customer , 
Strategy, T echnology, Operations, 
Data and People and Culture based 
on the sub-dimensions and criteria 
setforth by TMForum’s DMM model. 
Additionally, we ascertained the required 
internal advancements through distinct 
sub-programmes and projects tied to digital 
transformation activities. 
Measuring outcomes in both quantitative 
and qualitative terms allows us to track 
progress, ensuring alignment with 
targets at various timeframes. This 
systematic approach, rooted in the TM 
Forum framework, provides a structured 
method for evaluating our digital 
transformation success and fostering 
continuous improvement. The blueprint for 
implementation has been finalised, and we 
will be taking the measures required to put it 
into action.
Further , we have established a digital 
transformation core team and Steering 
Committee headed by the CEO and 
respective Chief Officers from SL T and 
Mobitel. We have also established six 
centre of excellence teams, with the aim of 
providing expertise and guidance to improve 
digital maturity across the six dimensions.
The Roadmap for Progress
Based on the current maturity level scores 
assessed in the AS-IS study, we derived a 
target Digital Maturity Score, that aligns with 
our Strategic Objectives of T ransforming 
SL T and Mobitel from T elco to T echco. In 
order to achieve these strategic objectives, 
we developed our Strategic Blue print 
formulating five sub-programmes under 
our DT programme.
30 Projects were defined under the 
5 sub-programmes to drive our Digital 
T ransformation Journey. This transition 
and greater digital maturity would increase 
our competitiveness, enable SL T and 
Mobitel to be more responsive to market 
needs, while maximising on opportunities 
stemming from Sri Lanka’s digital economy

We will continually improve our energy 
management by:
 • Educating employees to increase their 
environmental consciousness
 • Managing energy consumption and 
carbon emissions responsibly, especially 
by adopting energy efficient technologies 
and selecting the most environmentally- 
friendly sources of energy where possible
 • Making efficient energy management 
a consideration in all decision-making 
processes
 • Reviewing energy policy objectives 
and targets periodically and increasing 
awareness among stakeholders
 • Conducting energy audits and taking 
timely and effective corrective action 
 • Educating business partners and drawing 
them into contributing to effective 
energy usage
 • Inculcating awareness of the importance 
of energy conservation among SL T -
employee-families so that it will become 
a lifestyle choice
 • Expanding energy management culture 
to SL T subsidiaries.
This policy is applicable to all SL T business 
units and their employees.
Energy Management
The management of energy usage is 
monitored by cross-functional committees. 
Most of SL T’s energy consumption comes 
from network operations and not from the 
EUI of their buildings, which are designed 
with energy-efficient features such as 
solar panels, natural lighting, and insulation 
to reduce electricity consumption and 
carbon emissions. By prioritising sustainable 
infrastructure, SL T not only lowers 
operational costs but also minimises its 
environmental impact. 
Going beyond token initiatives in 
conservation, SL T has consistently 
demonstrated its commitment to the 
environment and natural resources through 
a number of initiatives. The Company has 
invested in eco-friendly technologies to 
reduce its carbon footprint, using energy-
efficient infrastructure and renewable 
energy sources, including energy-efficient 
lighting and air conditioning.
Installing solar panels to generate power 
is a significant step forward, especially 
considering our high energy consumption, 
and reliance on the national electricity grid 
to meet our needs. Expanding this initiative 
across our island-wide infrastructure will 
enhance our energy self-reliance, reduce 
energy costs which are currently very high, 
and bolster our environmental credentials 
to a considerable extent. Energy usage 
has been minimised by energy efficient 
equipment such as efficient air conditioners, 
lamps, switch mode rectifiers and inverters. 
Implementation of LED bulbs has resulted 
in savings of around 600MWh annually. 
SL T introduced energy-efficient inverter 
type air conditioners resulting in an energy 
saving of around 550MWh. Reduction of 
energy consumption during the year 2023 
is 10% compared to 2022. Solar systems 
were installed at 19 sites up to 2023 and 
30 sites are planned for 2024 under OPEX 
model without capital expenditure. Further 
approval was granted to install solar panels 
in 201 sites which will have an energy saving 
of around 10%. 
Expenditure on grid-based energy 
comprises a significant aspect of SL T’s 
cost structure, while also exposing it to the 
vagaries of the seasonality of hydro-power , 
in addition to frequent power outages. 
Mobitel Initiatives
The past two years have seen a dramatic 
rise in annual network energy costs, with 
costs escalating by 135%, when compared 
to 2021. This surge is primarily driven by 
large increases in electricity and fuel tariffs. 
Resulting in energy becoming the single 
largest cost factor within our network 
operations. T o address this challenge 
and ensure business resilience, we are 
prioritising the deployment of renewable 
energy solutions. This strategic shift aims 
to reduce dependence on commercially 
purchased power and fossil fuels; leading to 
significant reductions in cost and emissions, 
which in turn would contribute to the 
sustainability of our operations.
T o address rising energy costs and reduce 
our overall environmental footprint, 
Mobitel continues to develop renewable 
energy capacity. Phase 1 of a solar power 
deployment initiative successfully equipped 
300 network sites with solar solutions, 
adding 1748kW of renewable energy 
capacity. This translates to 3% of our total 
network energy needs now being met from 
clean and renewable energy sources. The 
transition to renewable energy sources is a 
crucial step towards reducing SL T’s carbon 
emissions and achieving our long-term 
goal of net-zero by 2050. Coincidentally, 
this shift has also contributed to increased 
network availability, as addition of alternative 
power sources has enhanced network 
resilience during power outages, driving 
progress towards a more self-sustainable 
network. 
Energy Efficiency Measures
Minimising energy wastage such as 
prevention of air-conditioning leakages, 
shutting down idle equipment, replacement 
of inefficient equipment, load shifting, 
turning off equipment (computers, lamps, 
air-conditioners etc.) when not in use, are 
the main energy saving measures taken 
during the year . In addition, consolidation 
of equipment and power systems to form 
common equipment rooms to utilise energy 
efficiently and effectively. 
Energy week was conducted throughout 
the Company to raise awareness amongst 
staff while providing hands-on experience 
for network teams. Throughout Energy 
Week, we held daily quiz programmes and 
an art competition for employees’ children. 
Winners were awarded prizes to encourage 
participation in energy-saving activities.
Progress in Carbon Neutrality
Since obtaining its initial Carbon 
Assessment ISO Standard in 2018, SL T 
has consistently tracked emissions, 
implemented eco-friendly practices, and 
strived to diminish its carbon footprint. 
The Company is following a clearly-defined 
strategy and roadmap towards achieving 
carbon-neutrality by 2040, which is ahead of 
the national goal of 2050.

Environment 
Waste Management Strategies
A comprehensive waste management 
policy, practices and conservation 
initiatives form an important aspect of 
SL T’s commitment to environmental 
sustainability. Implementing waste 
management strategies, including recycling 
programmes and responsible, eco-friendly 
disposal methods, forms a crucial part 
of our environmental stewardship. Given 
our use of high-tech products with a high 
e-waste component, we have adopted 
a number of measures towards their 
responsible disposal, adhering to relevant 
environmental regulations and standards 
set forth by the Government, as well as 
international norms. 
Our recycling initiatives for e-waste 
materials consists of their segregation 
and processing for reuse or proper 
disposal. SL T promotes the reuse and 
refurbishment of electronic devices that 
are still functional or repairable and has 
established programmes for collecting, 
refurbishing, and redistributing used 
electronics to extend their lifespan and 
reduce the demand for new products. 
SL T promotes awareness among its 
employees and stakeholders regarding the 
importance of e-waste management and 
encourages them to participate in recycling 
programmes. Moreover , the Company 
collaborates with certified e-waste 
management partners who specialise in the 
proper handling and disposal of electronic 
waste to ensure that electronics are 
recycled in an environmentally responsible 
manner , with components separated and 
recycled or properly disposed of according 
to regulations. T o safeguard sensitive 
information, SL T prioritises secure data 
wiping or destruction procedures when 
disposing of electronic devices. This 
ensures all personal or confidential data is 
completely removed before disposal.
SL T strives to reduce, reuse, and recycle 
paper waste, food waste, and e-waste 
across all operations, contributing towards 
a circular economy. This is an economic 
model that aims to minimise waste and 
maximise resource efficiency by keeping 
products, materials, and resources in use for 
as long as possible.
The Company reduces paper waste by 
promoting digitalisation, encouraging 
electronic communication and 
documentation, in addition to paper 
recycling programme, reduction in food 
waste is ensured by segregation of 
such material. E-waste is minimised by 
implementing sustainable procurement 
practices, choosing durable and upgradable 
equipment, and extending the lifespan 
of electronic devices through proper 
maintenance. Functional electronic 
equipment, including end-of-life equipment 
and equipment from clients’ premises, are 
refurbished and redeployed giving them  
a second life.
Our waste reduction and waste disposal 
processes have been certified by Central 
Environmental Authority. We have 
established our own copper recycling plant 
to facilitate the recycling of copper cables 
which can be sold to suppliers for their 
material value. During 2023, 26,500 Kgs 
of copper was recovered in the recycling 
process. Such recycling helps conserve 
the cost of mining and produced new 
copper , while generating employment 
opportunities. The disposal of materials and 
equipment along the same lines is carried 
out by Mobitel as well. 
ISO 14001: Environmental 
Management System Certification 
ISO 14001 is an internationally recognised 
standard for environmental management 
systems (EMS) that helps organisations 
establish and implement an effective 
approach to managing their environmental 
responsibilities. SL T is in the process of 
obtaining ISO 14001 by Q2 2024.
The primary goal of ISO 14001 is to help 
organisations improve their environmental 
performance by identifying and managing 
their environmental aspects and impacts 
more effectively. This can lead to reduced 
resource consumption, waste generation, 
and emissions.
T o ensure all operational and administrative 
activities comply with ISO 14001:2015 
requirements, SL T has established, 
documented, and implemented a robust 
Environmental Management System (EMS) 
with specific objectives. 
By establishing a system of processes, 
strategies, and procedures that direct 
performance toward environmental 
objectives and targets, the EMS is intended 
to help SL T address both compliance 
and environmental imperatives. The ISO 
14001:2015 standard places a strong 
emphasis on system performance 
improvement, and it is anticipated that 
SL T’s environmental performance will 
increase as a result. SL T believes that 
sound environmental management is a 
key component of its overall management 
responsibility.
The EMS applies to all operations including 
purchasing, designing and construction of 
new buildings and renovations, marketing, 
sales, waste disposal, and all other 
administrative functions.
In Sri Lanka’s telecommunications sector , 
ISO 14001 certification could provide a 
competitive edge. Customers who prioritise 
environmentally responsible companies 
might be more inclined to choose Sri Lanka 
T elecom over competitors without such 
certification.

Preservation of  
the Ecosystem 
In order to reverse the alarming trend of 
environmental degradation and habitat-
loss, SL T is actively engaged in tree planting 
and conservation projects to preserve 
biodiversity and restore ecosystems in 
selected areas across the country. By 
participating in reforestation efforts and 
supporting habitat conservation initiatives, 
these efforts not only contribute to 
environmental preservation, but also help 
offset the Company’s ecological footprint, 
fostering a more balanced relationship 
between business operations and the 
natural environment.
The ecosystem preservation initiative 
of SL T has been focused mainly on the 
tree planting programme, carried out 
in collaboration with corporates, NGOs, 
government organisations and local 
communities. We strongly believe that 
tree planting is crucial for environmental 
health, combatting soil erosion, and offering 
habitat for wildlife. Planting trees also 
enhances air quality, beautifies landscapes, 
and contributes to human well-being. 
These initiatives enhance the environment 
through improved forestation, fostering 
natural carbon sequestering, aiding 
greenhouse gas reduction, and promoting 
biodiversity. Additionally, they raise 
awareness of environmental conservation 
among nearby communities, fostering 
a deeper understanding of ecological 
stewardship. T o date, the Company has 
planted 2,000 trees Island-wide.
Engaging with Stakeholders
SL T recognises the importance of 
environmental education and awareness 
in fostering a culture of sustainability. 
Through various campaigns, workshops, 
and partnerships with environmental 
organisations, the Company promotes 
environmental consciousness among 
its employees, customers, and the wider 
community. Raising awareness about 
environmental issues and advocating 
for sustainable practices enables SL T to 
empower stakeholders to make informed 
decisions, and take collective action 
towards environmental protection.
Sri Lanka T elecom collaborates across 
its entire supply chain to achieve 
environmental sustainability by 
implementing the iSupplier online platform, 
carrying out various initiatives and fostering 
partnerships with suppliers, vendors, and 
other stakeholders. This includes sourcing 
materials and products from reputed 
international suppliers who demonstrate 
commitment to sustainable practices 
and environmental responsibility. Raising 
awareness about environmental issues 
and best practices for sustainability among 
supply chain partners helps ensure that 
everyone understands their role in achieving 
environmental goals.
Driving Sustainability  
Among Employees
SL T drives sustainability among employees 
through comprehensive initiatives 
encompassing education, training on 
sustainable practices, energy efficiency, 
and waste reduction. SL T fosters a culture

to assist customers in navigating the cloud-related transformations through insightful discussions and meaningful exchanges.
Building on these accomplishment, we launched the highly anticipated VMware Double Cloud Service in March 2023. Incorporating 
dual-cloud architecture that capitalises on the strengths of two distinct cloud environments; this innovative approach delivers the scale 
and agility of public cloud with the security and performance of private cloud infrastructure. It provides enterprises with unprecedented 
flexibility, redundancy, and adaptability.
In addition, VCL carries the prestigious VM Ware Cloud Verified Certification, 
achieved in 2023. SL T is the first service provider in Sri Lanka to obtain the 
certification with VCF deployment; displaying our commitment to meeting the 
highest industry standards for reliability, security, and performance. It positions 
SL T’s offering as a trusted and certified solution within the VM Ware ecosystem.
We organised a customer awareness event titled “Unlock the Power of Cloud-
Native Applications” , bringing together a panel of cloud experts, key medium and 
large enterprises, and government customers. The event explored the capabilities of SL T’s latest cloud offering and the potential for 
VCF to address customer challenges.
In 2023, SL T also partnered with Google Cloud to roll out use of Google Workspace communication and collaboration applications 
including Gmail, Chat, Meet, Calendar , Drive, Docs, Sheets, and more to make the digital transition and transformation easier for 
SMEs. Integration and adoption of Google Workspace promises a host of efficiency improvements, while promoting hybrid work, and 
expanding collaboration across enterprise teams.

Consumers
SL T’s consumer business centres primarily 
on provision of fibre-based broadband, 
mobile products, entertainment products, 
and fixed-line services to individuals and 
households across the island. Maintaining 
a presence across the country enables 
the creation and maintenance of enduring 
relationships with our customers, which is 
one of our key differentiators. Our extensive 
network of touchpoints also provides a 
robust platform for customer acquisition 
and customer service. 
 Consumer offering
 • Fixed and mobile voice and data 
connectivity
 • Bouquet of IPTV channels on PEOTV
 • Value added services (VAS)
 • Smart services
 • Smart home, networking, and 
premises solutions
 • Smart storage
Our unified touchpoints include localised 
regional teams and a strong network of 
dealer channels that contribute to sales and 
revenue. In the fixed-line business, external 
dealers make a significant contribution to 
the total revenue, while the mobile business 
relies heavily on strong connections with 
dealer channels, which play a crucial role in 
sales from the consumer business.
Strategic Approach to Drive 
Segmental Growth
Fixed-line
Aligned with a transformative trend across 
the globe where fibre-optics have spurred 
massive leaps in communication, fibre has 
grown to become the primary offering in our 
fixed-line business. Delivery of fibre to the 
home (FTTH) is an integral component of 
our vision for a smarter Sri Lanka and one 
of the central pillars of our growth strategy 
because of its remarkable bandwidth 
and speed. These elements make it a 
quintessential component of current and 
future consumer habits and lifestyles 
that are data-intensive and dependent 
on reliable, low-latency, high-speed 
connectivity. 
Despite having initially invested in laying 
an advanced fibre-optic based backbone 
network, additional capital expenditure 
(capex) was necessary for last-mile 
infrastructure to homes. Operational teams 
pioneered a proactive catchment-area 
concept to align further infrastructure 
investments to lay fibre loops in areas with 
the highest customer potential. Coupled 
with intensive campaigns to maximise 
customer acquisition while minimising line 
distances, the proactive strategy resulted in 
a minimal capex investment for line drawing 
and pole installation. Based on the success 
of these campaigns, we executed similar 
programmes in major locations with ample 
loops and potential households, surpassing 
the set fibre target by over 100%. 
For consumers who are not connected 
to fibre, SL T’s 4G L TE Home Broadband 
service offers a reliable and convenient 
solution. We provide attractive packages 
and data bundles to suit a variety of 
customer needs, prioritising convenience 
and flexibility. Additionally, customers can 
avail themselves of plug-and-play premise 
equipment that is simple to set up; allowing 
connection in minutes.
Sri Lanka’s economic crisis and worsened 
economic conditions of consumers and 
households, led to a notable increase in 
customer churn or dropping out post-
October 2022, worsening in the first 
quarter of 2023 due to new tax hikes. 
Comparatively high cost to customers was 
the primary driver for this churn. In light 
of these challenges, we made strategic 
efforts to enhance the sales process and 
implement more stringent measures 
based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
that ensured new sales exhibited specific 
characteristics, which would minimise 
the likelihood of customer churn. This 
process involved a detailed and measured 
approach that evaluated each milestone of 
customer acquisition, including assessing 
the effectiveness of campaigns, validating 
sales orders, and confirming collection of 
documentation and initial payments.
Mobile
We employed a multi-pronged strategy to 
strengthen our customer base, beginning 
with leveraging synergies between our 
fixed-line and mobile business. Attractive 
packages and bundled services with value 
proposition surpassing market offerings 
coupled with incentivised cross-selling  
in areas with strong fibre presence led to 
positive outcomes. Retaining a focus on 
attracting new customers, while pursuing 
further cross-selling, we worked to tap 
youth through family packages that cater 
to the particular needs of households 
that were existing fibre customers. 
Simultaneously we re-strategised our 
operations in mid-2023, bolstering 
the partner network with a sustainable 
incentivisation programme, to alleviate the 
Company’s financial burden and contribute 
to stabilising the mobile business.
Entertainment
PEOTV offerings were enriched with  
T rue HD Content to enhance the viewer 
experience throughout the year with 
multiple live sporting events offered FoC 
as a value-add to the entire customers 
base. The Event TV Channel portfolio was 
increased to offer more airtime to locally 
produced content from schools, universities 
and other communities.
Additionally, competitive packages were 
introduced to penetrate the North and 
East pay- TV market and this initiative was a 
successful measure taken to increase new 
connections from the North and East.
The “On The Go Entertainment experience” 
was enhanced by extending content to 
the mobile screen, targeting the mobile 
customer segment to enrich their mobile 
TV experience with multiple events and 
content offered at affordable prices.

Customer Experience
Our specialised Customer Experience 
T eam, together with SL T Management 
and all staff members across our 
touchpoints, provides a superior service 
experience to customers. Our efforts 
to enhance customer experience are 
enshrined in our strategy, with internal 
digitalisation efforts resulting in significant 
improvements to customers and the overall 
customer journey.
We have a group of Customer Experience 
Management Officers (CxEMOS) 
responsible for customer experience 
based at each touchpoint. They provide 
coordination for all staff members with 
Head Office Staff and other touchpoint 
owners to resolve customer issues as 
swiftly as possible. The team includes 
representatives from all internal stakeholder 
groups serving the SL T fixed line and 
mobile services. With continuous monthly 
training and review programmes, strong 
engagement activities, and annual 
conventions; we are committed to not only 
equipping our customer service teams, but 
also ensuring we listen and incorporate their 
knowledge of the pulse of customers. 
Alongside digitalisation efforts, we deployed 
a number of tools, such as Wi-Finder , which 
enable our teams and technical staff to 
install broadband routers at appropriate 
locations that have the strongest possible 
connectivity. Additionally, a Fibre-to-the-
Home (FTTH) tool is used to validate 
the quality of fibre connections. Analysis 
of customer behaviour and continuous 
assessment through a 3600 customer-view 
mobile app have also enriched our ability to  
serve customers.

to access services closer to home. For 
high-end users, we introduced blazing-fast 
1 Gbps packages, catering to those who 
demand the ultimate internet experience. 
T ailored Offerings and Flexibility

themselves of annual payment discounts, 
when paying up-front for a year of service. 
At the same time, to ensure flexibility, we 
also ensured customers had the option 
to employ instalment-payment plans 
to spread the cost of their connection. 
Combined or bundled packages were 
another feature that enabled our customers 
to obtain a customised combination 
of voice, TV , and internet services in a

vulnerabilities.
In alignment with global cybersecurity 
trends and addressing the unique needs 
within Sri Lanka, we have established a 24/7 
Security Operation Centre and introduced 
a Security Operation Centre as a Service 
(SOCaaS) in January 2024. Our adherence 
to ISO 27001 Information Security 
Management System across all operations

Digital Service Business. Each SBU 
offers distinct value propositions and 
business models, catering to diverse

made by the Board of Directors on 13 and 
20 February 2024, SL T Digital Services

IntroductionExecutive StatementsBusiness Context and 
Strategy
BusinessEnvironmentSocialGovernanceFinancial ReportsSupplementary 
Information
We take complete responsibility for the 
entire scope of turnkey projects – from 
planning and design, right up to delivery and 
commissioning.
The last few years have been the most 
challenging, due to the prevailing socio-
economic conditions, high inflation, and 
depreciation of the Sri Lankan currency, 
leading to cost escalations, and stiff 
competition to win limited projects in 
the market. Despite this challenging 
environment, we have sustained the 
Company, and grown it to a sizable extent 
while also making profits, which is a 
commendable achievement. Within the 
telco domain, we are exploring certain 
foreign development projects to extend our 
footprint further afield. We also collaborate 
with foreign companies as the ICT solutions 
contractor for large local projects.
We expect 2024 to be more promising as 
industries are opening-up, costs coming 
down, demand improving, and more 
opportunities arising for our SBUs.
Ensuring Reliability and Efficiency in 
the Face of Evolving T echnology
We consider technological advancements 
as an advantage rather than a challenge, 
as we see new opportunities emerging 
with new technology for which we adapt, 
leveraging quickly our talent pool with 
direction from progressive leadership. 
We have the requisite talent in the form 
of our own certified engineers, who are 
also specially trained to adopt the latest 
technologies and bring cutting-edge 
solutions to our customers. Further , we 
partner with key technology providers, who 
are global brands, to deliver our solutions. 
We identify the best possible products 
having great future potential that we 
should carry, and offer them as part of 
our solutions, which helps us win against 
competitive offerings.
Fostering a Culture of Innovation
Our focus on innovation spans the provision 
of new technology to the market as well 
as in the software domain, in addition to 
working on new product development. 
This provides us with a distinctive edge in 
terms of adding value and earning profits. 
However , we are hampered by the dearth 
of human resources in related domains, 
which has emerged as a major challenge 
that we are facing right now. Innovation 
is also facilitated by our partnerships with 
numerous local and foreign technology 
partners, who represent leading brands 
catering to particular solutions or domains.
Constant engagement with customers and 
feedback from our own staff and agents, 
helps us obtain in-depth knowledge of 
customer needs, which in turn enables us 
to improve our services, as well as engage in 
innovations where required. 
Focus on Sustainability of  
our Solutions
Sustainability remains one of our key areas 
of focus, especially in terms of solutions 
we offer , which are scalable, adaptable, 
customisable and sustainable in the 
long-term. We also ensure that these 
solutions are cost-effective at the outset 
and over their lifetime while requiring 
minimal maintenance. 
T o assure our own Company of its 
long-term sustainability, the Management 
is highly detail-oriented, which includes a 
meticulous analysis of performance, future 
cash flows and profitability, with forward-
facing plans being made accordingly.
T raining and Development  
for our Staff
We recruit our staff members from leading 
local and international universities and 
educational institutes using a stringent 
hiring process to ensure a proper 
technological and cultural fit with our 
Organisation. While our staff are highly 
qualified in their respective domains, we 
provide proper training based on project 
requirements, in addition to internal training 
programmes where we engage our own 
experts, as well as resource personnel from 
technology partners. Certification from 
technology partners is a prerequisite in this 
domain, which is carried out regularly.
Having such qualified and motivated staff, 
as well as the rich legacy and resources 
of SL T helps us keep abreast of the 
latest technological advances, which 
empowers us to be true to our vision of 
being the strongest and most trusted 
National Information and Communication 
T echnology (ICT) solutions provider .
Digital Service Business
Our Digital Service Business focuses on two 
service lines: Marketing Services and Digital 
Engagement Solutions, utilising combined 
expertise and leveraging synergies to offer 
clients bespoke, best-in-class solutions. 
The business follows a technology-driven 
business strategy, positioning us as a 
leader in the ever-evolving marketing and 
technological landscape and ensuring we 
can meet the challenges and opportunities 
presented by the latest advancements.
Marketing Services – This pillar consists of 
Advertising and Marketing – which covers 
advertising (outdoor and online), branding 
(interior and exterior), creative content, 
animation, 2D /3D video production, 
motion graphics, as well email, SMS and IVR 
campaigns and promotions, in addition to 
information listing platforms, SEO content 
development and advanced local search 
engines.
Digital Engagement – This pillar covers 
digital marketing options, software, and 
digital platform. While directory platform 
was a one-way information driven business, 
we are in the process of converting it into 
an interactive, transactional platform, which 
can help engagement and loyalty building.
Outstanding Performance and 
Significant Achievements
During 2023, we were able to collect 
LKR 618 Mn. for the year , which is a 
significant achievement when considering 
the fact that we had only made the 
shift quite recently from our previous 
engagement in directory publishing.
As part of our new initiatives for the year , 
we have shifted to certain digital products 
such as a platform for school attendance 
and notification systems with the potential 
to scale up to more areas in the future. This 
will be offered free of charge, with the only 
payment being for the message notification 
charges for notifying parents. 
We have also made considerable progress 
in developing our own digital marketplace in 
the form of an e-commerce platform, which 
would aggregate sellers and connect buyers 
across Sri Lanka, in handling a multitude of 
products across a number of categories, 
and targeting various demographics. 
 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 63
As part of our digital platforms services, 
we have recently built an e-commerce 
platform for a client engaged in the 
hardware business, selling over 10,000 
products /stock keeping units (SKUs). This 
marks our most recent and largest foray 
into e-commerce. Most of our customer-
base, which numbers over 3,000 SMEs and 
other ventures in various fields, are planning 
to transition their businesses to online 
platforms, giving us considerable scope to 
extend our footprint into the online domain.
Helping Stakeholders Excel in a 
Challenging Environment
Our stakeholders are mainly in the B2B 
sector , specifically SME businesses, in 
addition to government institutions, and 
retail organisations who have benefited in 
taking their businesses to the next level 
through the next-generation technological 
solutions we provide. We intend on taking 
this further , by reaching out and providing 
similar solutions to existing clients who have 
already been with us for a long period and 
part of our directory information business 
and advertising domain. 
Since a number of traditional businesses 
are likely to be taken over by their children 
who are more tech-savvy, we are moving 
towards providing them with specific and 
accurate information to help them navigate 
the complexities and challenges of the 
next generation in enterprise-building. 
For this segment, we have introduced 
digital marketing, advertising and software 
solutions to improve their businesses, in 
addition to software and tools such as 
Workflow Management System (WMS), 
E-Voucher System, Invoice Management 
System, Fleet Management system etc. 
which will help the next generation be a part 
of our roadmap to success.
Focusing on Niche Markets
Our current business directory functions 
as a national business directory, providing 
information on a wide range of private 
sector and government institutions, as 
well as products, brands, and various other 
categories. We have taken this a step 
further by identifying niche categories, 
around which a market and ecosystem 
can be built, connecting a wide variety of 
relevant stakeholders. One such niche 
relates to “weddings as an industry” in 
which we have been engaged for a long 
period. Another industry is tourism which 
will benefit our country's economy by 
generating employment opportunities and 
earning foreign exchange. The third niche 
we have identified is the automobile sector , 
which connects a number of automobile 
industry products, services and events.
Building an ecosystem around a niche 
market involves tailoring products and 
services to address the specific needs of 
that segment while fostering partnerships 
with complementary businesses. By 
identifying unique characteristics and 
preferences, our Digital Service Business 
can establish community platforms, and 
provide value added services to further 
enhance customer engagement and loyalty. 
Innovation and Research in 
Developing New Offerings
This is one of the areas that we want 
to focus on, as forming international 
partnerships will be immensely helpful in 
terms of research and development, which 
will help us penetrate the global market. 
While insights from the SL T Research 
Centre will help us customise our solutions 
to the local market, the experience and 
technologies of global players can be a 
game-changer in maximising our potential. 
We have entered into a number of 
partnerships, which include a global 
software company, and growth marketing 
company to work with their product 
portfolio within the Sri Lankan context. We 
have also signed up with another technical 
partner , which helped us launch the school 
attendance notification system. While we 
do have our internal development team, we 
are quite open to the idea of collaborative 
models involving global players who are 
leaders in their respective domains.
Whatever solution we provide, be it 
software, web development or ecommerce  
the cybersecurity aspect needs to be 
considered as a priority concern. While 
engaged in hosting, cloud solutions, or 
data centre solutions, we rely on the SL T 
network, as well as the SL T data centre, 
which is among the most secure and 
certified data centres in the country. 
When working with global players, we rely 
on Amazon and other reliable reputed 
organisations who offer the best in 
cybersecurity.
Supporting Small and  
Medium Enterprises to  
Leverage Digital T ools
This is one of the key areas that our 
Digital Service Business is engaged in at 
present, since we have sizable traditional 
businesses as part of our client portfolio. 
T o take them to the next level, we carry out 
a meticulous analysis of their business and 
introduce them to our digital tools which 
are best-suited for their specific needs. For 
instance, in the case of brick and mortar 
operations, we first establish their online 
digital presence by using various means 
such as websites, ecommerce applications, 
online directories, virtual shops, and social 
media profile pages which will help bring 
online traffic to their business. As the next 
step, we offer digital marketing, social 
media campaigns, and search engine 
optimisation, in addition to blending their 
online and offline campaigns for maximum 
mileage. Introducing such solutions 
through our product portfolio also helps 
traditional businesses to embrace digital 
transformation. 
By synergising our Group capabilities, 
we help clients in terms of connectivity 
and other data solutions by offering fibre 
and PEOTV as per their needs. We also 
facilitate their transition to automation. 
A case in point is a pilot site of our client’s 
fleet management solution involving IoT 
applications which help the client to monitor 
and manage their vehicle fleet more 
efficiently.
We also provide clients with required 
software development solutions such as 
workflow management systems. These 
were especially helpful during the pandemic 
period when the workflow of employees 
working from home had to be managed 
effectively. Once we onboard such clients, 
we go on to propose relationship tools to 
manage staff and build loyalty. 
With our available resources, as well as 
highly competent personnel, we look 
forward to the coming year with confidence, 
and the resolve to advance our frontiers to 
new, uncharted territories.

PEOTV Business
Our PEOTV Business follows an ambitious 
goal of becoming Sri Lanka’s largest video 
content hub. T o this end, we work to 
aggregate, develop, store, and distribute 
content across various streaming platforms. 
We deliver content through two main 
channels: PEOTV (IPTV), a subscription-
based service with wired connectivity, 
and PEO MOBILE (OTT), alongside other 
emerging OTT platforms.
SL T’s PEOTV offering is subscription-
based, and offers several advantages over 
traditional television media like antenna-
based or Direct-to-Home (DTH). The wired 
connection enables interactive features 
like time-shifting, rewinding, and video-
on-demand, significantly enhancing the 
customer viewing experience.
Focusing on Elevating  
Customer Experience
Our strategic emphasis remains on PEOTV , 
recognising the growing importance 
customers place on the quality of their 
viewing experience. This is best achieved 
through unparalleled high-definition (HD) 
picture quality delivered via the SL T fibre 
connection. Currently, PEOTV boasts the 
most extensive HD Content selection, 
including Local Free to Air channels in HD, 
most of which are exclusive to PEOTV . 
Aligning with global trends such as the rise 
of OTT and Entertainment On Demand, 
we aim to offer a diverse entertainment 
portfolio. Securing multiple Content rights 
for IPTV , OTT , and ad insertion throughout 
the year , particularly for major sporting 
events, has bolstered customer loyalty and 
revenue generation. T o gauge customer 
satisfaction and integrate feedback for 
service enhancement, we have established 
a dedicated Customer Experience 
Management T eam to collect customer 
input. Additionally, we conduct independent 
customer satisfaction surveys. Utilising the 
feedback received, we conduct internal 
analyses with cross-functional teams to 
gain insights into customer preferences, 
tailor or develop products, and establish 
pricing structures that ensure affordability.
We also produce proprietary content 
distributed through our “Charana TV” 
channel, accessible on PEOTV , PEO 
MOBILE, cable TV platforms, and Y ouT ube. 
Our original children’s content, “Sootikka,” 
comprising animated music and the novel 
initiative on animated storybooks for kids, 
is tailored for PEOTV , PEO MOBILE, and 
other digital platforms, aiming to generate 
supplementary revenue. Furthermore, we 
have successfully developed and launched 
an enhanced IPTV platform, laying the 
foundation for the implementation of 
cutting-edge features that will significantly 
elevate the overall customer experience.
Significant Achievements
During this period, PEOTV has achieved a 
commendable growth in revenue of 14%, 
while carefully optimising our operational 
costs which are sensitive to fluctuations of 
foreign exchange.
Our most significant achievement this 
year was the successful launch of our open 
standard Android-based, feature-rich 
Set- T op Box (STB), which has transformed 
conventional televisions into smart TVs, 
offering users an enhanced viewing 
experience. The open platform of our STB 
allows users to access a wide range of 
content and services from various providers. 
With the capability to receive software 
updates, our STBs enable customers to 
enjoy new features and enhancements over 
time, ensuring the device remains current 
and relevant.
The introduction of STBs has not only 
expanded our revenue streams but also 
enabled us to offer additional services 
such as premium content subscriptions, 
app downloads, and value-added services. 
Despite operational dependencies 
sensitive to forex fluctuations, our PEOTV 
Business has achieved commendable 
revenue growth by optimising our common 
operational processes.
In 2023, Charana TV significantly increased 
its reach and popularity by introducing 
innovative programming concepts. Our 
channel’s dedication to showcasing diverse 
musical talent was recognised at the 
prestigious 29th Sumathi Awards, where 
“Kavi Dahayata Gee Dahayak” was awarded 
the Best Musical Programme of the Y ear . 
Charana TV’s programs have garnered 
numerous accolades, nominations, and 
placements throughout the year .
T raining and Development
T o ensure our staff remains at the forefront 
of industry advancements, we provide 
comprehensive training and development 
opportunities in product development, 
creativity, technology, and content. Our 
commitment to continuous learning is 
exemplified by ongoing technical training 
programmes that lead to certification for 
our employees.
Partnerships and Collaborations to 
Enhance Service Offerings
Our Company has established 
long-standing and mutually advantageous 
partnerships in both content and 
technology with prominent local and 
international entities. Furthermore, we have 
fostered close collaborations with proficient 
Sri Lankan content developers who face 
challenges due to limited resources, 
infrastructure, and licensing for operating 
a Free- T o-Air (FT A) channel. In response 
to this issue, we have extended our 
support by offering them access to PEOTV 
as a platform. This platform serves as the  
single largest platform for non-FT A 
channels, providing a showcase for 
the talents and capabilities of these 
independent content creators.

Looking to 
the Future
We are focused on expanding our 
market presence in the fibre sector 
through PEOTV . Additionally, we 
have partnered with our sister 
company, Mobitel, to deliver popular 
and in-demand content to our 
mobile customer base, enhancing 
customer retention by offering 
affordable entertainment options 
on mobile devices. Our collaboration 
with global partners allows us to stay

providing our staff with opportunities 
to attend overseas conferences and 
enhance their knowledge base.
By participating in various global 
programmes and staying abreast 
of technological developments, we 
maintain a competitive edge in the 
industry. While our traditional delivery 
method has been cable-based, we 
are transitioning towards wireless 
solutions, particularly for enterprise 
clients and select hotels equipped 
with PEOTV wireless services. We 
are working towards offering wireless 
options to other customers, although 
wired connectivity currently offers a 
superior viewing experience.
In the near future, we are preparing 
to launch PEOTV services on 4G 
L TE, extending television services 
to the SL T wireless customer 
base. Recognising the importance 
of affordability, especially in light 
of economic conditions, we are 
committed to addressing this concern 
to ensure our services remain 
accessible to all customers.

Attracting the Best T alent 
Based on Future Needs
In terms of the younger demographic, 
we, along with other telecommunications 
companies and various industries in 
Sri Lanka, encounter a common challenge: 
attracting top talent. This demographic 
seems to prioritise flexibility, including 
remote work, hybrid arrangements, 
and project-based gig opportunities. 
Consequently, we are adapting to these 
preferences and are actively enhancing 
our flexible work arrangements to better 
engage with the new generation of talent. 
However , it remains a significant challenge 
to recruit and retain top talent, as a 
considerable number of qualified individuals 
are opting to leave Sri Lanka.

Further , in the backdrop of higher rate of 
brain drain in the country, we are evaluating 
new areas for attracting top talent. We are, 
also structuring the levels of talent that 
we want to attract, evaluating current and 
future needs. We need to optimise our 
talent to meet emerging needs, especially 
in terms of applications, solutions and 
software. The hiring of consultants would 
help us look at potential hires in terms of the 
skill set, rather than qualification.
Retaining Staff through 
Rewards and Recognition
Employees at SL T are regularly 
acknowledged through a variety of rewards 
and recognition programmes. These 
include the Call-Center Star Award and 
the Champions of the Month initiative. 
Each month, outstanding employees 
are commended in various categories 
such as RTOM (Regional T elecom Office 
Manager) of the month, OPMC (Outside 
Plant Maintenance Centre) Manager of the 
Month, REBM (Regional Enterprise Business 
Manager) of the month, Engineer SA&SF 
(Service Assurance and Service Fulfilment)
of the Month, Network Engineer of the 
Month, Sales Manager of the Month, and 
Channel Manager of the month. These 
accolades celebrate excellence across 
different roles and departments within the 
Organisation.
SL T’s employee engagement process 
encompasses various activities including 
biannual sales team faceoffs, religious 
events, club memberships, CSR initiatives, 
participation in sports events such as 
the SL T Games, and interactive seminar 
sessions. These initiatives aim to foster a 
sense of community, promote teamwork, 
and enhance employee satisfaction within 
the Organisation. Through a diverse 
range of engagement opportunities, 
SL T encourages active participation 
and collaboration among its employees, 
contributing to a positive work environment 
and overall organisational success.

Equitable Pathways for 
Career Progression
We take immense pride in our technical 
prowess within the industry, boasting some 
of the finest telecom experts in Sri Lanka 
across SL T , Mobitel, and associated 
subsidiaries. However , attracting top talent 
presents challenges due to the differing 
mindset of younger professionals towards 
legacy organisations like ours. While we 
strive to promote from within to leverage 
our Organisation’s expertise, particularly 
in areas such as the fibre network and 
nationwide infrastructure which are 
unique to us, recruiting externally can 
be challenging. Consequently, internal 
promotions are often prioritised, although 
we occasionally seek external candidates, 
particularly in non-engineering roles. Our 
selection process is meticulously structured 
and ingrained within the Organisation for 
every promotion and recruitment. These 
standards are periodically enhanced, 
ensuring transparency throughout the 
selection and promotion processes. 
Therefore, necessary revisions have been 
initiated for a new Staff Recruitment & 
Promotion Scheme (SRPS) that can meet 
our above requirement.
Given below are details of the performance 
management and career progression of 
staff.
 • Made significant changes in the appraisal 
rating scale 
 • Implementation of performance 
calibration process
Objective of performance calibration is 
to enhance fairness and accuracy of the 
performance management process.
When the annual performance assessment 
is carried out, a calibration committee 
engages with the process at two levels in 
the organisation.
a. Chief Officer level for calibration of General 
Manager and Deputy General Manager level
b. General Manager level calibration for rest of 
the organisation below them
 • Implementation of Expert Path and 
People Manager Path
We embarked on clarifying career 
progression paths for our employees in two 
distinct directions.
a. Expert Path: Employees with deep 
understanding and proficiency in technical 
aspects of their respective functions can 
progress their career in this path.
b. People Manager Path: This is for employees 
who are willing to take their career on a tract 
where the responsibility of managing people 
increases.
Maintaining Enduring 
Relations with Staff Members
CEO’s Circular No: 50 /2023 on “Establishing 
industrial harmony through Committee for 
Inclusive Management (CIM)” was published 
in July 2023 with the view of improving the 
employee-employer relationship within SL T .
The Committee for Inclusive Management 
(CIM) proactively address grievances or 
concerns among our workforce before they 
escalate. This entails engaging with over 
20 trade unions, within Sri Lanka T elecom 
alone, to discuss their most urgent issues at 
the CIM, where resolutions are sought. 
T rade unions can easily raise their issues/ 
demands/concerns as well as share their 
ideas and proposals on Company growth 
initiatives etc. to a single point of contact 
so that such matters can be followed 
up and receive the responses from the 
correct stakeholder at CIM meetings. 
Similarly, management also can make their 
suggestions, explain and update the trade 
unions properly at the same forum. Also, it 
allows the Management to share important 
information, decisions, and organisational 
updates with employee representatives in a 
transparent and timely manner .
The intended aims of the Committee for 
Inclusive Management (CIM) also includes 
several objectives: improving two-way 
communication, promoting employee 
engagement, resolving workplace issues, 
influencing decision-making, enhancing 
employee satisfaction, and boosting 
organisational performance. Additionally, 
the CIM aims for early identification of 
issues, fostering collaborative problem-
solving, and increasing organisational 
flexibility. These objectives collectively 
support the CIM’s mission to create a 
more inclusive and effective management 
approach within the Organisation.
Grievance Handling and 
Whistle Blowing
The Grievance Handling Committee has 
been established for the expeditious 
settlement of employee grievances while 
ensuring the creation and sustenance of a 
healthy employer-employee relationship. 
The Committee will have oversight 
responsibilities, duties, and authority with 
respect to the grievances received from 
employees.
The Grievance Handling Committee meets 
at least once a month and at least three 
members shall be present in a meeting. 
The Committee considers only individual 
grievances of employees raised individually 
by the concerned aggrieved party. The final 
settlement of any grievance shall be made 
within a reasonable period (not exceeding 
one month) after the recommendations 
are submitted to the CEO by the Grievance 
Committee.
Additionally, we introduced a whistle-
blowing policy last year , a first for our 
Organisation, enabling individuals 
to anonymously report concerns or 
complaints through designated channels.
Whistleblowing procedure provides safe 
channels for Whistleblowers to report 
concerns about, suspected serious 
misconduct of SL T employees or any 
breach or suspected breach of law or 
regulation or conflicts of interest that 
may adversely affect the company, the 
company’s customers, shareholders, 
employees, investors or the public at 
large and to come forward and express 
such genuine concerns without fear of 
punishment or unfair treatment.

IntroductionExecutive StatementsBusiness Context and 
Strategy
BusinessEnvironmentSocialGovernanceFinancial ReportsSupplementary 
Information
A Panel comprising four members, who are 
completely independent of SL T Group has 
been appointed to the Whistleblowing Unit 
to conduct preliminary investigations into 
any reported incidents (complaints). The 
Unit is required to carry out a preliminary 
investigation into the reported incident and 
identify whether there is a prima-facie case 
to proceed further with an internal audit /
forensic audit or investigation and submit 
a report to the Audit Committee, which will 
direct the Chief Internal Auditor and the 
CEO to take appropriate action.
The management will put in place a process 
to ensure that there will be no retaliation or 
victimisation against whistleblowers. The 
management expects all whistleblowers 
to use this mechanism to raise genuine 
concerns in a responsible manner in order 
to ensure its effectiveness.
 Furthermore, we have enhanced both 
the grievance procedure and the Code 
of Conduct. Certain processes are being 
redesigned and redeployed, considering our 
status as a unified organisation.
The merger necessitated the 
establishment of uniform standards 
and practices. Instituting a common 
competency framework will facilitate fairer 
decision-making regarding promotions, 
assessments, and recruitment processes. 
This framework will encompass leadership 
qualities, technical proficiencies, and 
standard procedures. Additionally, we are 
in the process of formalising a code of 
conduct, with process mapping already 
underway. 
Additional measures taken with regard to 
furthering the interests of staff members 
include:
 • Automation of many paper-based 
processes
 • Implemented SL T -MOBITEL combined 
organisational structure
 • Introduction of SL T Group Whistle-
blowing procedure
 • Introduction of SL T Group Code of 
Conduct and Disciplinary Procedure
 • Re-designing of Regional T elecom Office 
(RTO) structure
 • Flexible duty off time for non-executives

The Process of Managing Changes within the Organisation
As we implement organisational changes, particularly in people management, we 
encounter the need to further convince the value of the change. This resistance stems 
from management advocacy for change and staff acknowledgement of its importance in 
navigating the evolving technological landscape. Currently, we are addressing operational 
issues and aligning employees with our chosen direction, which has been a positive process 
overall, albeit with expected challenges. We have laid the groundwork for impactful people 
management changes and plan to fully execute these plans in the coming year .

The telecommunications landscape is a 
complex web of interconnected services. 
In today’s dynamic market, our business 
success hinges on effective collaboration. 
As such, prioritising long-term strategic 
partnerships with key suppliers and business 
partners is a strategy that continues to hold 
forth for SL T . 
Our partnerships with global and local 
players contributes to achieving business 
goals and objectives, including positioning 
us to deliver cost-effective solutions 
that cater to the diverse needs of our 
customer segments. Partnerships also 
foster innovation, enabling development 
of groundbreaking solutions that spread 
benefits to a wider group. By contributing 
to developing a robust network of partners, 
we remain committed to strengthening 
Sri Lanka’s digital and telecommunication 
ecosystem, and ensuring a seamless and 
efficient flow of services to end-users.
In 2023, SL T became a service 
provider to join the Oracle 
PartnerNetwork (OPN). This 
achievement would enable the 
Company to offer enhanced 
enterprise application development, 
cloud integration, and application 
management services to clients. 
Access to Oracle products like 
Exadata, Database Appliance, Oracle 
VM, Oracle Enterprise Manager , 
Oracle SQL Developer , and Oracle 
Solaris 11 would empower clients 
with reliable licenced software to run 
critical workloads on a scalable and 
secure cloud infrastructure.
Supplier Relationships
We employ diverse strategies to efficiently 
manage relationships with suppliers, 
ensuring a cost-effective and seamless 
procurement process, along with the 
timely delivery of contracts and products, 
adhering to global standards and SLAs. Our 
achievement of necessary cost-efficiencies 
and economies of scale in purchases can 
be primarily attributed to our practice of 
negotiating as a group, instead of individual 
entities negotiating independently. Notably, 
 • Suppliers are evaluated and ranked 
based on a well-defined set of criteria 
encompassing quality, reliability, 
innovation, sustainability practices, and 
competitive pricing. This ensures we 
partner with reliable and forward-thinking 
companies – in Sri Lanka and overseas.
 • Supplier development entails training 
programmes, awareness forums, 
and other knowledge-sharing and 
collaborative problem-solving 
opportunities.
 • Open tenders and proactive 
communication, keeps suppliers 
informed of future needs; allowing for 
better planning, reduced risks, greater 
efficiency, and mutual benefits for parties 
involved.
Partnerships, Alliances, and 
External Associations 
SL T has built a network of partnerships with 
local and international business entities and 
other service providers. The relationships 
built with the Government, enterprise 
customers and domestic operators are 
considered mutually beneficial and continue 
to contribute towards SL T’s mission of 
innovating for the future. 
Partnerships include those with national 
institutes to facilitate the growth of 
Micro and SME business segments and 
undertake initiatives relating to stakeholder 
engagement, professional and industry 
networks, market traction, solution 
modelling, and joint offers. These include:
 • The National Enterprise Development 
Authority
 • The National Chamber of Exporters
 • The Small Enterprise Development 
Authority
 • CA SME T ask Force
 • ICT Agency of Sri Lanka
Partners and Suppliers
we have consolidated annual maintenance 
Contract (AMC), particularly in IT 
investments. Adoption of a unified licensing 
model and consolidated AMC negotiations, 
provides us with strengthened negotiating 
power , enhanced pricing, and other benefits 
that we can extend to customers. 
Updates to our procurement approval 
process, has continued to bring positive 
results through faster tender processes 
for our suppliers. The Company’s global 
price benchmarking exercise, for frequently 
procured items, has succeeded in 
maximising price and term benefits while 
strengthening our direct relationships with 
suppliers.
In our commitment to consistently achieve 
Service Level Agreements (SLAs), we 
emphasise the importance of effective 
measurement and monitoring. Whether 
it is SLAs or Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs), we advocate for a robust monitoring 
mechanism. T o facilitate this, we are in the 
process of developing specific dashboards 
that allow us to monitor various stages of 
processes, such as procurement, payment, 
and inventory management, including the 
reaching of economic order levels and 
the timing for triggering the next order . 
The implementation of these dashboards 
equips decision-makers with accurate data 
crucial for business success.
Strengthening the Supply 
Chain
SL T’s suppliers play a vital role in delivering 
the technology and resources that keep 
Sri Lanka connected. From network 
management to facilities management, 
our operational divisions, Procurement 
Department, and Group companies all 
collaborate extensively with a wide range of 
partners. Throughout our engagements, 
we prioritise building strong, collaborative 
relationships that would bolster the 
telecommunications supply chain.
SL T has implemented a comprehensive 
supplier management programme for the 
Group that includes a rigorous selection 
process, continuous investment in the 
capabilities of suppliers, and transparent 
communications and engagement.

(IESL), is powered by SL T . The event’s 
2023 iteration was themed Industry 
4.0, representing the transformative 
potential of the “fourth industrial 
revolution” fuelled by advancements 
in digital technologies, automation, 
and data exchange. The SLIoT 
Challenge provided an engaging 
and rewarding platform for students 
and undergraduates to showcase 
innovative ideas and troubleshoot 
smart solutions incorporating IoT 
technology.
 Day of Code 2023
SL T and STEMUP Educational 
Foundation partnered to host the 
“Day of Code 2023” , with the aim 
of encouraging interest in and 
advancement of computer science 
education among Sri Lankan students 
and educators. This is the second 
consecutive year the event was 
organised, in line with the Computer 
Science Education Week (CSEdWeek) 
held in December 2023.
Environment and Education
Alongside efforts to reduce the 
environmental footprint of our 
operations, the Company is involved in 
raising awareness and promoting better 
environmental practices through our ESG 
initiatives. As part of the “Rata Pura Husmai 
Pohorai Waga Karamu” initiative, which aims 
to improve air quality, reduce emissions, and 
promote healthier soil, we carried out tree 
planting and book donation programmes 
at several schools across the island. The 
projects initiated renovations of school 
libraries, donated a variety of books, and 
enabled planting of tree saplings. The 
project is expected to benefit over 2,000 
students by enriching their knowledge and 
inculcating the habit of reading.
Our efforts to support STEM education 
and foster innovation are strengthened by 
collaborations with leading institutions and 
secondary and tertiary education providers. 
With the long-term goal of equipping and 
future-proofing an empowered Sri Lankan 
workforce, we are also contributing 
to creating a pipeline of talent for the 
Country’s technology sector .
In 2023, we partnered with the STEMUP 
Educational Foundation to empower 
student entrepreneurship through STEM 
education. The initiative conducted an 
enlightening “Hour of Code” workshop, 
made contributions via the “Sithak Athnam 
Pothak Denna” book donation programme, 
repaired and re-equipped school computer 
labs, and promoted environmental 
awareness through tree-planting projects.
CoderDojo
Focused on younger students, aged eight 
to sixteen, SL T and STEMUP Educational 
Foundation founded the CoderDojo skill 
development programme to drive STEM 
learning opportunities and coding, while 
promoting critical thinking, creativity, and 
analytical skills. Now in its second year , the 
programme is conducted at three Nebula 
Institute of T echnology centres and fifteen 
public libraries across the Island; continuing 
to spark the interest of hundreds of youth. 
In the long-term, efforts like these are 
contributing to close the Nation’s ICT 
skill-gap and usher in a technologically 
advanced, digital economy.

Health
SL T stepped up to address the critical 
shortage of essential drugs in state-run 
hospitals. A contribution of LKR 8 Mn. worth 
of medications across eight provinces 
was aimed at ensuring patients have 
access to necessary treatments, including 
anaesthetics, medications for hypertension, 
antibiotics, and other life-saving drugs.
As part of our commitment to support 
the healthcare sector and better health 
for Sri Lankans, SL T Group donated vital 
medicines and essentials goods to the 
Apeksha Hospital in Maharagama, to 
commemorate International Women’s 
Day. In another milestone, the Group’s 
eChannelling platform launched an 
innovative Eco Channelling service. This 
service personalises medicine delivery by 
offering doorstep distribution, powered 
by the Group’s newly launched mAgent 
network.

performance, operational affairs, human 
resources and matters concerning 
industrial relations.

performance each year against 
pre-established performance criteria, which 
were mutually agreed upon at the beginning 
of the year by the NGC and the Board. The 
evaluation of the CEO’s performance and 
determination of compensation are based 
on this assessment and are collectively 
agreed upon by both parties.
The Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary reports directly 
to the Board and is accessible to individual 
Directors regarding Board procedures. 
In addition to assisting the Chairman 
with delivery of the agenda, especially in 
planning the annual cycle of Board and 
Board Committee meetings, the Company 
Secretary ensures timely provision of 
detailed information to Board members. 
While providing guidance to Directors 
on Board procedures and corporate 
governance matters, the Company 
Secretary also serves as the Secretary to all 
Board subcommittees.

Enterprise Risk Management
In the rapidly evolving telecommunications sector , risk management 
emerges as a critical priority for companies striving to navigate 
uncertainties while ensuring the safety of customers and stakeholders, 
securing the Company’s assets, and fostering growth. For SL T , a leading 
telecom entity, this commitment to risk management is not just about 
mitigating threats but also about leveraging opportunities that arise 
amidst these challenges. The integration of risk management into SL T’s 
operations is designed to enhance decision-making processes, thereby 
aligning the Company’s risk assessment and response strategies with its 
overarching strategic objectives.
Risk Leadership and Governance
At the core of SL T’s risk management ethos is the belief that effective 
leadership and governance are indispensable. The Company’s Senior 
Management plays a pivotal role in embedding a risk-conscious 
culture throughout the Organisation. Through the establishment of 
a comprehensive risk management framework, SL T delineates its risk 
management philosophy, appetite, tolerance levels, and the approach 
towards identifying, assessing, and addressing risks. This framework is 
vital in guiding the Organisation through the complexities of various risk 
types, including those that could significantly impact SL T’s reputation, 
operational efficiency, human resources, and financial health. By 
fostering an environment where risk management is vigorously 
supported and actively engaged in by the leadership, SL T ensures 
that risk considerations are integral to the formulation of key business 
strategies and decisions.
Audit Committee
The governance structure of SL T’s risk management efforts is anchored 
by the Audit Committee, which doubles as the Risk Management 
Committee (RMC). Endorsed by the Board of Directors, the RMC 
represents the highest level of risk management oversight within the 
Company. This Committee is instrumental in overseeing the Enterprise 
Risk Management (ERM) function, ensuring that risk management 
practices are not only implemented but also aligned with the Company’s 
strategic direction and operational requirements.
ERM Standards
SL T’s adherence to the ISO 31000:2018 guidelines underscores its 
commitment to a structured and effective risk management approach. 
The incorporation of these standards into its ERM framework is 
complemented by SL T’s initiative to integrate best practices developed 
within the Organisation, thereby enhancing the robustness and 
relevance of its risk management efforts.
Risk Process and Activities
The dynamic nature of the telecommunications industry, compounded 
by external factors such as economic crises and technological 
advancements, necessitates a proactive and agile approach to risk 
management. In 2023, SL T navigated through a plethora of risks, 
including financial instability due to exchange rate volatility. Against this 
backdrop, SL T’s approach to risk management emphasises simplicity, 
clarity, and efficiency across all business domains. This strategy enables 
the Company to foster a culture of shared responsibility, aggregate 
risks, and ensure consistent application of its risk management 
practices. Through a systematic and rigorous risk review process, SL T 
remains adept at identifying, monitoring, and managing risks, thereby 
safeguarding the Company’s interests and ensuring business continuity.
The Company has been facing a number of critical risks to sustain and 
ensure its business continuity. These, among others, included:
Risk Risk level
Potential Mergers and Acquisitions in the industry
With the involvement of industrial stakeholders discussing 
on fair resource allocation for a healthy competition. 
Critical
Regulatory initiatives, which could negatively impact on 
the business
Methodology of future spectrum allocation will impact to 
the business. Also there are potential new regulations. SL T 
already engaged with regulator to minimise the impact.
Critical
High customer churn due to competition and economic 
conditions
Addressing with competitive products and increasing 
service levels.
Critical
The risk of OPEX increases to manage business 
operations
Having implemented effective cost management initiatives 
to minimise the effect of increasing energy cost and other 
cost components
Critical
Liquidity risk
T o manage risk of collection, bad debt and delay in payment 
of bills due to prevailing situation, actions have been taken.
High
Impact to critical business functions due to employee 
turnover/unavailability/unrest
The brain drain issue the country has been facing also 
impacting the Organisation as well. Retaining talents has 
become a potential risk.
High
New industry specific policies and taxes
Discussions are in progress with the involvement of industry 
stakeholders
High
SL T’s dedicated approach to risk management, supported by strong 
leadership, governance structures, adherence to international 
standards, and comprehensive risk processes and activities, positions 
the Company to effectively manage the spectrum of risks it faces. This 
strategic orientation not only protects SL T from potential adversities but 
also empowers it to seize growth opportunities, thereby reinforcing its 
commitment to stakeholders and securing its position as a leader in the 
telecommunications sector .

Other Information included in 
the 2023 Annual Report
Other information consists of the information 
included in the Annual Report, other than the 
Financial Statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon. Management is responsible for the 
other information.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does 
not cover the other information and we do 
not express any form of assurance conclusion 
thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial 
Statements, our responsibility is to read the 
other information and, in doing so, consider 
whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the Financial Statements 
or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. 
If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in 
this regard.
Responsibilities of the 
management and those 
charged with governance
Management is responsible for the preparation 
of Financial Statements that give a true and fair 
view in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting 
Standards, and for such internal control as 
management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error .
In preparing the Financial Statements, 
management is responsible for assessing the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless management either 
intends to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but 
to do so.
Those charged with governance are 
responsible for overseeing the Company’s and 
the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’ s responsibilities 
for the audit of the Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the Financial 
Statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error , 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs 
will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, 
we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
 z Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the Financial Statements, 
whether due to fraud or error , design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error , as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
 z Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the internal controls of the Company and 
the Group.
 z Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness 
of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management.
Independent Auditor’s Report
124 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 
 z Conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the Financial 
Statements or , if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However , future events or conditions 
may cause the Group to cease to continue 
as a going concern.
 z Evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the Financial Statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether 
the Financial Statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
 z Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of 
the entities or business activities within 
the Group to express an opinion on the 
consolidated Financial Statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.
We communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on  
our independence, and where applicable 
actions taken to eliminate threats or 
safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the Financial Statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Report on other legal and 
regulatory requirements
As required by section 163 (2) of the 
Companies Act No. 07 of 2007, we have 
obtained all the information and explanations 
that were required for the audit and as far 
as appears from our examination, proper 
accounting records have been kept by the 
Company and the Group.

(g) Going concern
As at 31 December 2023, the current liabilities 
of the Company exceeded current assets by 
LKR 23,624 Mn. 
A cash flow forecast for the 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial 
statements was prepared to assess and 
confirm the appropriateness of the going 
concern basis for the preparation of the 
financial statements of the Group. Based 
on the cash flow forecast, the Group has 
sufficient funds to fulfil its obligations for the 
next 12 months from the date of approval of 
the financial statements, with the assumption 
that the Company`s board approved 
Syndicated T erm Loan of LKR 39 Bn. will be 
obtained within the next few months. As at 
the date of these financial statements, the 
Company has secured firm commitments 
from participating banks totaling LKR 39 Bn. 
and are going through the process of finalising 
the Syndicated T erm Loan Agreement. The 
Group is confident of meeting the key terms 
and expects to conclude the new financing 
within the next few months.
Accordingly, these financial statements have 
been prepared on the going concern basis.
3. Significant Accounting 
Policies
The accounting policies set out below have 
been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in Financial Statements, and have 
been applied consistently by the Group 
entities, except amendments to existing 
accounting standards which are effective 
from 1 January 2023 as described in 
Note 3 (v). 
(a) Basis of consolidation
(i) Business combinations
The Group accounts for business 
combinations using the acquisition method 
when control is transferred to the Group. 
The consideration transferred in acquisition 
is generally measured at fair value, as are the 
identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill 
that arises is tested annually for impairment. 
Any gain or bargain purchase is recognised in 
profit or loss immediately. T ransaction costs 
are expensed as incurred, except if related to 
the issue of debt or equity securities.
The consideration transferred does not 
include amounts related to the settlement 
of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts 
are generally recognised in Statement of 
Profit or Loss.
Any contingent consideration is measured 
at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an 
obligation to pay contingent consideration that 
meets the definition of a financial instrument 
is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured 
and settlement is accounted for within equity. 
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair 
value of the contingent consideration are 
recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for 
non-controlling interests and any previous 
interest held over the net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed). If the fair 
value of the net assets acquired is in excess of 
the aggregate consideration transferred, the 
Group re-assesses whether it has correctly 
identified all of the assets acquired and all 
of the liabilities assumed and reviews the 
procedures used to measure the amounts 
to be recognised at the acquisition date. If 
the reassessment still results in an excess of 
the fair value of net assets acquired over the 
aggregate consideration transferred, then the 
recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured 
at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquire are assigned to 
those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a 
cash-generating unit (CGU) and part of the 
operation within that unit is disposed of, 
the goodwill associated with the disposed 
operation is included in the carrying amount 
of the operation when determining the gain 
or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in 
these circumstances is measured based on 
the relative values of the disposed operation 
and the portion of the cash-generating 
unit retained.
(ii) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled 
by the Group. The Group controls an entity 
when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the Consolidation of 
a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains 
control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Group loses control over the subsidiary.
(ii- a) Critical judgements in 
applying the entity’ s accounting 
policies
The directors have concluded that the Group 
controls all subsidiaries as it has majority 
control and voting rights over its subsidiaries 
as depicted in Note (ii-b).

Sky Network (Private) Limited was dissolved on 28 August 2023 by way of Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation.
(iii) Equity – accounted investees 
(Investment in associates and joint 
ventures)
An associate is an entity over which the 
Group has significant influence. Significant 
influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the 
investee but is not control or joint control over 
those policies.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement 
whereby the parties that have joint control 
of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions 
about the relevant activities require unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining 
significant influence or joint control is similar 
to those necessary to determine control over 
subsidiaries. The Group’s investments in its 
associates and joint venture are accounted for 
using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment 
in an associate or a joint venture is initially 
recognised at cost. The carrying amount 
of the investment is adjusted to recognise 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets 
of the associate or joint venture since the 
acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the 
associate or joint venture is included in the 
carrying amount of the investment and is not 
tested for impairment separately.
The Statement of profit or loss reflects the 
Group’s share of the results of operations of 
the associate or joint venture. Any change 
in other comprehensive Income of those 
investees is presented as part of the Group’s 
other comprehensive Income. In addition, 
when there has been a change recognised 
directly in the equity of the associate or joint 
venture, the Group recognises its share of any 
changes, when applicable, in the statement of 
changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses 
resulting from transactions between the 
Group and the associate or joint venture are 
eliminated to the extent of the interest in the 
associate or joint venture.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit 
or loss of an associate and a joint venture is 
shown on the face of the Statement of profit 
or loss outside operating profit and represents 
profit or loss after tax and non-controlling 
interests in the subsidiaries of the associate or 
joint venture.
The Financial Statements of the associate 
or joint venture are prepared for the same 
reporting period as the Group. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to bring 
the accounting policies in line with those of 
the Group.
After application of the equity method, the 
Group determines whether it is necessary 
to recognise an impairment loss on its 
investment in its associate or joint venture. At 
each reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that the 
investment in the associate or joint venture is 
impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group 
calculates the amount of impairment as the 
difference between the recoverable amount of 
the associate or joint venture and its carrying 
value, and then recognises the loss as ‘share of 
profit or loss of equity accounted investees’ in 
the statement of profit or loss.
Upon loss of significant influence over the 
associate or joint control over the joint 
venture, the Group measures and recognises 
any retained investment at its fair value. Any 
difference between the carrying amount of 
the associate or joint venture upon loss of 
significant influence or joint control and the fair 
value of the retained investment and proceeds 
from disposal is recognised in the statement 
of profit or loss.
(iv) Non controlling interest ( NCI)
NCI are measured at their proportionate 
share of acquiree’s identifiable net assets at 
the date of acquisition. Changes in the group 
interest in a subsidiary that do not result in 
a loss of control are accounted for as equity 
transactions. 
(v) Loss of control
When the group loses control over a subsidiary, 
it derecognises the asset and liabilities of the 
subsidiary and any related NCI (if applicable) 
and other components of equity. Any resulting 
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any 
interest in the former subsidiary is measured 
at fair value when control is lost.
Notes to the Financial Statements
134 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 
(vi) T ransaction eliminated on 
consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions and any 
unrealised income and expenses arising from 
intra-group transactions, are eliminated.
(b) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
T ransactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into the respective functional 
currencies of Group companies at the 
exchange rates at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at 
the reporting date. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities that are measured at fair value 
in a foreign currency are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate 
when the fair value was determined. Foreign 
currency differences are generally recognised 
in statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income. Non-monetary items 
that are measured based on historical cost in a 
foreign currency are not translated.
(c) Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that 
gives rise to a financial asset of one entity 
and financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity.
(i) Financial assets
(i-i) Initial recognition and 
measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial 
recognition, as subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, Fair Value Through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) and Fair 
Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL). 
The classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the financial asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics and 
the Group’s business model for managing 
them. With the exception of trade receivables 
that do not contain a significant financing 
component or for which the Group has applied 
the practical expedient, the Group initially 
measures a financial asset at its fair value 
plus, in the case of a financial asset not at 
fair value through profit or loss, transaction 
costs. T rade receivables that do not contain a 
significant financing component or for which 
the Group has applied the practical expedient 
are measured at the transaction price as 
disclosed in Note (k) - Revenue from contracts 
with customer . 
In order for a financial asset to be classified 
and measured at amortised cost or fair value 
through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash 
flows that are ‘solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred 
to as the SPPI test and is performed at an 
instrument level. Financial assets with cash 
flows that are not SPPI are classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
irrespective of the business model.
The Group’s business model for managing 
financial assets refers to how it manages its 
financial assets in order to generate cash flows. 
The business model determines whether cash 
flows will result from collecting contractual 
cash flows, selling the financial assets, or 
both. Financial assets are not reclassified 
subsequent to their initial recognition unless 
the Group changes its business model for 
managing financial assets, in which case all 
affected financial assets are reclassified on the 
first day of the first reporting period following 
the change in the business model. Purchases 
or sales of financial assets that require delivery 
of assets within a time frame established 
by regulation or convention in the market 
place (regular way trades) are recognised on 
the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.
(i-ii) Subsequent measurement 
For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
financial assets are classified in four 
categories;
 z Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
 z Financial assets at fair value through OCI 
with recycling of cumulative gains and 
losses (debt instruments)
 z Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI with no recycling of cumulative 
gains and losses upon derecognition (equity 
instruments)
 z Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
The Group measures financial assets at 
amortised cost if both following conditions 
are met:
 z The financial asset is held within a business 
model with the objective to hold financial 
assets in order to collect contractual cash 
flows, and
 z The contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding
Financial assets at amortised cost are 
subsequently measured using the effective 
interest rate (EIR) method and are subject to 
impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in 
profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, 
modified or impaired.
The Group’s financial assets at amortised cost 
include trade and other receivables, amounts 
due from related parties and cash and cash 
equivalents. 
Financial assets at fair value through 
OCI (debt instruments)
The Group measures debt instruments at 
fair value through OCI if both of following 
conditions are met:
 z The financial asset is held within a business 
model with the objective of both holding to 
collect contractual cash flows and selling, 
and
 z The contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
For debt instruments at fair value through 
OCI, interest income, foreign exchange 
revaluation and impairment losses or reversals 
are recognised in the statement of profit or 
loss and computed in the same manner as 
for financial assets measured at amortised 
cost. The remaining fair value changes are 
recognised in OCI. Upon derecognition, the 
cumulative fair value change recognised in OCI 
is recycled to profit or loss.
Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI (equity instruments)
Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect 
to classify irrevocably its equity investments 
as equity instruments designated at fair value 
through OCI when they meet the definition of 
equity under LKAS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation and are not held for trading. The 
classification is determined on an instrument-
by-instrument basis.
Gains and losses on these financial assets are 
never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised as other income in the statement 
of profit or loss when the right of payment 
has been established, except when the Group 
benefits from such proceeds as a recovery 
of part of the cost of the financial asset, in 
which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. 
Equity instruments designated at fair value 
through OCI are not subject to impairment 
assessment.

Strategy
Business/ProsperityEnvironmentSocialGovernanceFinancial ReportsSupplementary 
Information
 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 135
This category includes listed and non listed 
equity instruments that the Group elected to 
classify irrevocably.
Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial assets held for trading, 
financial assets designated upon initial 
recognition at fair value through profit or loss, 
or financial assets mandatorily required to 
be measured at fair value. Financial assets 
are classified as held for trading if they 
are acquired for the purpose of selling or 
repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, 
including separated embedded derivatives, 
are also classified as held for trading unless 
they are designated as effective hedging 
instruments. Financial assets with cash flows 
that are not solely payments of principal and 
interest are classified and measured at fair 
value through profit or loss, irrespective of 
the business model. Notwithstanding the 
criteria for debt instruments to be classified 
at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, 
as described above, debt instruments may be 
designated at fair value through profit or loss 
on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or 
significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss are carried in the statement of financial 
position at fair value with net changes in fair 
value recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss.
This category includes derivative instruments 
and listed equity investments which the Group 
had not irrevocably elected to classify at fair 
value through OCI. Dividends on listed equity 
investments are also recognised as other 
income in the statement of profit or loss when 
the right of payment has been established.
A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, 
with a financial liability or non-financial host, 
is separated from the host and accounted 
for as a separate derivative if: the economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related 
to the host; a separate instrument with the 
same terms as the embedded derivative would 
meet the definition of a derivative; and the 
hybrid contract is not measured at fair value 
through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives 
are measured at fair value with changes 
in fair value recognised in profit or loss. 
Reassessment only occurs if there is either 
a change in the terms of the contract that 
significantly modifies the cash flows that would 
otherwise be required or a reclassification of 
a financial asset out of the fair value through 
profit or loss category.
(i-iii) Fair value measurement
SLFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that 
would be received to sell and asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transactions 
between market participants at the 
measurement date.
 A fair value measurement requires an entity to 
determine all the following;
1. The particular asset or liability that is the 
subject of the measurement.
2. For a non-financial asset, the valuation 
premise that is appropriate for the 
measurement (consistently with its highest 
and best use). 
3. The principal (or most advantageous) 
market for the asset or liability.
4. The valuation technique(s) appropriate 
for the measurement, considering the 
availability of data with which to develop 
inputs that represent the assumptions that 
market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair 
value hierarchy within which the inputs are 
categorised.
5. Fair value is a market-based measurement, 
not an entity-specific measurement. For 
some assets and liabilities, observable 
market transactions or market.
When transaction price provides the best 
evidence of fair value at initial recognition, 
the financial instrument is initially measured 
at the transaction price and any difference 
between this price and the value initially 
obtained from a valuation model is 
subsequently recognised in profit or loss 
on an appropriate basis over the life of the 
instrument but not later than when the 
valuation is supported wholly by observable 
market data or the transaction is closed out.
Determination of fair values
The determination of fair value for financial 
assets and liabilities for which there is no 
observable market price requires the use of 
valuation techniques. For financial instruments 
that trade infrequently and have little price 
transparency, fair value is less objective 
and requires varying degrees of judgment 
depending on liquidity, concentration, 
uncertainty of market factors, pricing 
assumption and other risks affecting the 
specific instrument.
– Level 1 - fair value measurements using 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities;
– Level 2 - fair value measurements using 
inputs other than quoted prices included 
within level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from 
prices);and
– Level 3 - fair value measurements using 
inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (i.e., 
unobservable inputs).
(i-iv) Amortised cost
The amortised cost of a financial asset or 
liability is the amount at which the financial 
asset or liability is measured at initial 
recognition, minus principal repayments, 
plus or minus the cumulative amortisation 
using the effective interest method of 
any difference between the initial amount 
recognised and the maturity amount, minus 
any reduction for impairment.
(i-v) Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
Financial assets not classified at fair value 
through profit or loss, are assessed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is 
objective evidence of impairment. 
Objective evidence that financial assets are 
impaired includes; 
– default or delinquency by a debtor;
– restructuring of an amount due to the 
Group on terms that the Group would not 
consider otherwise;
– indications that a debtor or issuer will enter 
bankruptcy;
– adverse changes in the payment status of 
borrowers or issuers;
– the disappearance of an active market for a 
security; or
– Observable data indicating that there is a 
measurable decrease in the expected cash 
flows from a group of financial assets.
In addition, for an investment in an equity 
security, a significant or prolonged decline in its 
fair value below its cost is objective evidence 
of impairment.
For trade receivables and contract assets, 
the Group applies a simplified approach in 
calculating Expected Credit Losses (ECLs). 
Therefore, the Group does not track changes 
in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss 
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 
reporting date. The Group has established a 
provision matrix that is based on its historical 
credit loss experience, adjusted for forward 
looking factors specific to the debtors and the 
economic environment.
Notes to the Financial Statements
136 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 
The Group considers a financial asset in default 
when contractual payments are 90 days past 
due. However , in certain cases, the Group may 
also consider a financial asset to be in default 
when internal or external information indicates 
that the Group is unlikely to receive the 
outstanding contractual amounts in full before 
taking into account any credit enhancements 
held by the Group. A financial asset is written 
off when there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovering the contractual cash flows.
Investments in fixed deposits , T reasury Bills 
and Bonds are considered as low risk of default.
Non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its non-financial assets 
(other than investment property, inventories 
and deferred tax assets) to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. If 
any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is 
tested annually for impairment.
For impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets 
that generates cash inflows from continuing 
use that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows of other assets or CGUs.
Goodwill arising from a business combination 
is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that 
are expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the combination.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is 
the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the 
estimated future cash flows, discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the 
carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds 
its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or 
loss . They are allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a 
pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not 
reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, 
net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.
(i-vi) Hedge
For designated and qualifying cash flow 
hedges, the effective portion of the gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument is initially 
recognised directly in equity in the “cash flow 
hedge reserve” . The ineffective portion of 
the gains or losses on the hedge instrument 
is recognised immediately in the profit 
and loss. 
When the hedge cash flow affect the Income 
Statement, the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recorded in the corresponding 
income or expense line of the Income 
Statement. When a hedging instrument 
expires, or is sold, terminated, exercised or 
when a hedge no longer meet the criteria 
for hedge accounting, any cumulative gains/
losses existing in other comprehensive 
income at that time remains in other 
comprehensive income and is recognised 
in the income statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur 
the cumulative gains/loss was reported in 
other comprehensive income is immediately 
transferred to the Income Statement.
(ii) Financial liabilities
(ii-i) Initial recognition and 
measurement
Financial Liabilities are classified, at initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
payables, or as appropriate. 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at 
fair value and , in the case of loans, borrowings, 
vendor financing and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade 
and other payables, loans and borrowings 
including bank overdrafts, vendor financing, 
lease liabilities, contract liabilities and 
deferred income.
(ii-ii)Subsequent measurement
This is the category most relevant to the 
Group. After initial recognition, interest-
bearing loans and borrowings and vendor 
financing are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the EIR method, after 
considering any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. Gains and losses are 
recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities 
are derecognised. EIR amortisation is  
included as finance costs in the statement  
of profit or loss.
(ii-iii) Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged 
or cancelled or expires. When an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised 
in the statement of profit or loss.
(iii) Offsetting of financial 
instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is reported in the 
consolidated statement of financial position 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to 
offset the recognised amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment 
are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
The cost of self-constructed assets includes 
the cost of materials and direct labour and any 
other costs directly attributable to bringing the 
assets to a working condition for their intended 
use. Purchased software that is integral to 
the functionality of the related equipment is 
capitalised as part of that asset.
When parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, 
they are accounted for as separate items 
(major components) of property, plant 
and equipment. 
(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment is recognised 
in the carrying amount of the item if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits 
embodied within the part will flow to the 
Group and its cost can be measured reliably. 
The costs of the day-to-day servicing 
of property, plant and equipment are 
recognised in profit or loss.

(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable 
amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other 
amount substituted for cost, less its residual 
value. Depreciation is recognised in profit or 
loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful lives of each part of an item of property, 
plant and equipment. In the year of acquisition 
depreciation is computed on proportionate 
basis from the month the asset is put into 
use and no depreciation will be charged to 
the month in which the particular asset was 
disposed. Leased assets are depreciated over 
the shorter of the lease term and their useful 
lives unless it is reasonably certain that the 
Group will obtain ownership by the end of the 
lease term. Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation method, useful lives and residual 
values are reviewed at each reporting date and 
adjusted if appropriate.
The estimated useful lives for the assets are 
as follows:
Freehold buildings 5 - 40 years
Submarine cables 10 - 25 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
CDMA handsets 3 years
PABX System 1-6 years
IT Systems 5 - 10 years
Other fixed assets 2 - 12.5 years
Network equipment
Ducts, cables and other 
outside plant 4 - 20 years
T elephone exchanges and 
transmission equipment 5 -12.5 years
T owers 40 years
(iv) Capital work-in-progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost 
net of accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
These are expenses of a capital nature directly 
incurred in the construction of buildings, 
network equipment, system development and 
other fixed assets, awaiting capitalisation.
Major spare parts and project related inventory 
qualify as property, plant and equipment 
when the entity expects to use them during 
more than one year period and are used in 
connection with specific items of property, 
plant and equipment.
(v) Derecognition
“The carrying amount of an item of property, 
plant & equipment is derecognised on disposal. 
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of 
property, plant and equipment are determined 
by comparing the proceeds from disposal 
with the carrying amount of property, plant 
and equipment and are recognised net within 
“other income” in the statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive Income.
When replacement costs are recognised in 
the carrying amount of an item of property, 
plant and equipment, the remaining carrying 
amount of the replaced part is derecognised. 
Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each 
such capitalisation, the remaining carrying 
amount of the previous cost of inspections is 
derecognised.
(vi) Borrowing cost
Borrowing cost directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of 
a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a 
substantial period of time to get ready for 
its intended use or sale are capitalised as 
part of the cost of the respective assets. All 
other borrowing costs are expensed in the 
period they occur . Borrowing costs consist of 
interest and other costs that an entity incurs in 
connection with the borrowing of funds.
(e) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries.
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of 
subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. For 
measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, 
see Note 3 (a) (i) 
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
(ii) Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets that are acquired 
by the Group, which have finite useful lives, 
are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses.
(iii) Licenses
Separately acquired licenses are shown at 
historical cost. Expenditures on license fees 
that is deemed to benefit or relate to more 
than one financial year is classified as license 
fee and is being amortised over the License 
period on a straight line basis.
(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only 
when it increases the future economic 
benefits embodied in the specific asset to 
which it relates. All other expenditure, including 
expenditure on internally generated goodwill is 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
The estimated useful lives for the intangible 
assets are as follows:
Licences 2 - 10 years
Software 1-10 years
Others 5 years
(f ) Right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities
Leases
The Group assesses at contract inception 
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That 
is, if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration.
Group as a lessee
The Group applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except 
for short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities 
to make lease payments and right-of-use 
assets representing the right to use the 
underlying assets.
Right-of-use assets 
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at 
the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the 
date the underlying asset is available for use). 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less 
any accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, 
and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives 
received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the 
lease term and the estimated useful lives of 
the assets, as follows: 
Leased assets Estimated 
useful lives
Buildings 2-5 years
T owers 2-5 years
Notes to the Financial Statements
138 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 
If ownership of the leased asset transfers 
to the Group at the end of the lease term or 
the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase 
option, depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset. The right-
of-use assets are also subject to impairment 
as more fully described In Note (U) (ii) - 
Impairment of Assets.
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the 
Group recognises lease liabilities measured 
at the present value of lease payments to 
be made over the lease term. The lease 
payments include fixed payments (including 
in-substance fixed payments) less any 
lease incentives receivable, variable lease 
payments that depend on an index or a rate, 
and amounts expected to be paid under 
residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase 
option reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Group and payments of penalties 
for terminating the lease, if the lease term 
reflects the Group exercising the option to 
terminate. Variable lease payments that do not 
depend on an index or a rate are recognised as 
expenses (unless they are incurred to produce 
inventories) in the period in which the event or 
condition that triggers the payment occur .
In calculating the present value of lease 
payments, the Group uses its incremental 
borrowing rate at the lease commencement 
date because the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of 
interest and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of 
lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a 
modification, a change in the lease term, a 
change in the lease payments (e.g., changes 
to future payments resulting from a change in 
an index or rate used to determine such lease 
payments) or a change in the assessment of 
an option to purchase the underlying asset.
The Group’s lease liabilities are included in 
rights-of-use assets and lease liabilities in 
Note 14 to the Financial Statements.
Leases of low-value assets 
The Group applies the lease of low-value 
assets recognition exemption to leases of 
some tower rentals that are considered to 
be low value. Lease payments on leases 
of low-value assets are recognised as 
expenses on straight-line basis over the 
lease term. 
Group as a lessor 
Leases in which the Group does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership of an asset are classified as 
operating leases. Rental income arising is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over 
the lease terms and is included in revenue 
in the statement of profit or loss due to its 
operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in 
negotiating and arranging an operating lease 
are added to the carrying amount of the leased 
asset and recognised over the lease term on 
the same basis as rental income. Contingent 
rents are recognised as revenue in the period 
in which they are earned.
(g) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. The cost of 
inventories is based on the weighted average 
cost principle. Value of inventories includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring, conversion 
costs and other costs incurred in bringing 
them to their existing location and condition.
(h) Share capital
Ordinary share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the 
issue of ordinary shares and share options are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net of 
any tax effects.
(i) Government grants
Government grants are recognised initially at 
fair value when there is reasonable assurance 
that they will be received and the Group 
will comply with the conditions associated 
with the grant. Grants that compensate the 
Group for expenses incurred are recognised 
in the statement of Profit or Loss and Other 
Comprehensive Income as other income 
on a systematic basis in the same periods in 
which the expenses are recognised. Grants 
that compensate the Group for the cost of 
an asset are recognised in the of profit or loss 
on a systematic basis over the useful life of 
the asset.  
(j) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-
employment benefit plan under which 
contributions are made into a separate 
fund and the entity will have no legal or 
constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. Obligations for contributions to 
defined contribution plan are recognised 
as an employee benefit expense in profit 
or loss in the periods during which services 
are rendered by employees. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to 
the extent that a cash refund or a reduction 
in future payments is available. 
Employees’ Provident Fund
All employees of the Company are members 
of the Sri Lanka T elecom Provident Fund to 
which the Company contributes 15% of such 
employees’ basic salary and allowances. 
All employees of subsidiaries of the Group 
are members of Employees’ Provident Fund 
(EPF), to which the respective subsidiaries 
contribute 12% of such employees’ basic 
salary and allowances. Employees of 
Sri Lanka T elecom (Services) Limited are 
members of Employees’ Provident Fund 
(EPF), where the company contribute 
15% of such employees’ basic salary 
and allowances.
Employees’ T rust Fund
The Company and other subsidiaries 
contribute 3% of the salary of each employee 
to the Employees’ T rust Fund. 
(ii) Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan other than a defined contribution 
plan. The defined benefit is calculated by an 
independent actuary using Projected Unit 
Credit method as recommended by LKAS 19 
“Employee Benefits” The present value of 
the defined benefit obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows using the yield on Government Bonds 
at the reporting date and have maturity dates 
approximating to the terms of the Company’s 
obligations.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and 
losses that arise in calculating the Group’s 
obligation in respect of a plan in other 
comprehensive income. 
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation depends on a number of factors 
that are determined on an actuarial basis using 
a number of assumptions. Key assumptions 
used in determining the defined retirement 
benefit obligations are given in Note 26. Any 
changes in these assumptions will impact the 
carrying amount of defined benefit obligations.
Provision has been made for retirement 
gratuities from the first year of service 
for all employees, in conformity with 
LKAS 19 “Employee Benefits” . However , 
under the Payment of Gratuity Act No.12 
of 1983, the liability to an employee 
arises only on completion of five years of 
continued service.

(iii) T ermination benefits
T ermination benefits are recognised as an 
expense when the Group is demonstrably 
committed, without realistic possibility of 
withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either 
terminate employment before the normal 
retirement date, or to provide termination 
benefits as a result of an offer made to 
encourage voluntary redundancy. T ermination 
benefits for voluntary redundancies are 
recognised as an expense if the Group has 
made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it 
is probable that the offer will be accepted, 
and the number of acceptances can be 
estimated reliably. 
(iv) Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are 
measured on an undiscounted basis and are 
expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount 
expected to be paid under short-term cash 
bonus or leave encashment plans if the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to pay this amount as a result of past service 
provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
(k) Revenue from contracts with 
customers
“The Group is primarily involved in providing a 
broad portfolio of telecommunication services 
across Sri Lanka. In addition, the range of 
services provided by the Group include, inter 
alia, voice and broadband services, domestic 
and international leased circuits, broadband, 
satellite up-link, maritime transmission, IPTV 
service, directory publishing service and 
educational services.
Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or 
services are transferred to the customer at 
an amount that reflects the consideration 
to which the Group expects to be entitled in 
exchange for those goods or services. The 
Group has generally concluded that it is the 
principal in its revenue arrangements.
(i) Performance obligations relevant 
to contracts
As a telecommunication service provider , 
the Group’s performance obligation related 
to service contracts include the installation 
services and maintenance services provided 
and the uninterrupted telecommunication 
service which will be provided throughout the 
connection period.
The Group expects that above performance 
obligations would be satisfied throughout the 
connection period.
Domestic and international call revenue 
and rental income 
Fixed lines
Revenue for call time usage by customers 
is recognised as revenue as services are 
performed on accrual basis. Fixed rental is 
recognised as income on a monthly basis in 
relation to the period of services rendered. 
Mobile Revenue
Mobile revenue comprises amounts charged 
to customers in respect of monthly access 
charges, airtime usage, messaging, and the 
provision of other mobile telecommunications 
services. Mobile monthly access charges are 
invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic 
billing cycle. Air time, either from contract 
customers as part of the invoiced amount or 
from prepaid customers through the sale of 
prepaid cards, is recorded in the period in which 
the customer uses the service.
Revenue from other network operators 
and international settlements
The revenue received from other network 
operators, local and international, for the use 
of the Group’s telecommunication network 
are recognised, net of taxes, based on usage 
taking the traffic minutes/per second rates 
stipulated in the relevant agreements and 
regulations and based on the terms of the 
lease agreements for fixed rentals. 
Revenue arising from the interconnection 
of voice and data traffic between other 
telecommunications operators is recognised 
at the time of transit across the Group’s 
network and presented on gross basis. The 
relevant revenue accrued is recognised 
under income in the Income Statement and 
interconnection expenses recognised under 
operating costs in profit or loss.
Revenue from broadband 
Revenue from Data services and IPTV services 
is recognised on usage and the fixed rental on 
a monthly basis when it is earned net of taxes, 
rebates and discounts.
Revenue from other ICT services
The revenue from other telephone services 
are recognised on an accrual basis based on 
fixed rental contracts entered between the 
Group and subscribers.
Recognition of deferred income
The connection fees relating to Public Switch 
T elephone Network (PSTN) are deferred over a 
period of 15 years. LKR revenue is recognised 
on an annual basis irrespective of the date 
of connection.
IRU revenue relating to leasing of SEA-ME-WE 
4 cable capacity are recognised on a straight 
line basis over the period of the contracts. 
Amounts received in advance for any services 
are recorded as deferred revenue. In the event 
that a customer terminates an IRU prior to 
the expiry of the contract and releases the 
Company from the obligation to provide future 
services, the remaining unamortised deferred 
revenue is recognised in the period the 
contract is terminated.
Backhauling revenue which is leasing of 
SEA-ME-WE 3 cable capacity is recognised 
on a straight line basis over the period of 
contracts. Amounts received in advance for 
any services are recorded as deferred revenue.
Revenue from the sale of prepaid CDMA cards 
is deferred until such time as the customer 
uses the call time, downloadable quota or the 
credit expires.
Sale of mobile recharge cards and reloads for 
prepaid subscribers are initially recognised 
as deferred revenue until such time as 
the subscribers use the services or credit 
period expires.
(ii) New connection fees
The Group provides installation services 
relevant to the new connections of fixed and 
mobile telecommunication services including 
both voice and non-voice categories. These 
installation services are bundled together 
with providing of Customer Premises 
Equipment (CPE) to customers in fixed line 
voice and some non-voice services. When 
the performance obligations relevant to such 
installation services are performed, CPEs 
provided to customers are considered as 
assets of the Group as long as the contracts 
with customers are valid. Accordingly, the 
Group allocates a bundled price for the 
equipment and installation services for 
such facilities.
(iii) Recognition of contract 
liabilities
“The Group concluded that revenue from 
new connections in fixed and mobile 
telecommunication services is to be 
recognised over time because the customer 
simultaneously receives and consumes 
the benefits provided by the Group. The 
fact that another entity would not need to 
reperform the installation of the service that 
the Group has provided to date demonstrates 
that the customer simultaneously receives 
and consumes the benefits of the Group’s 
performance as it performs.
Notes to the Financial Statements
140 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 
The Group identifies the revenue for 
installation services as a contract liability and 
recognises the revenue on a systematic basis 
that is consistent with the entity’s transfer of 
the related goods or services to the customer 
since satisfaction for the installation services 
will be consumed by the customer over the 
contract period.
(iv) Costs incurred in securing 
customer contracts
The Group identifies the sales commission 
paid to sales team for each new connection 
contract and other such related costs in 
contract acquisition as costs incurred in 
securing customer contracts.
(v) Recognition of contract 
assets 
Contract acquisition costs are recognised as a 
contract asset and subsequently recognised 
as an expense over the life of a contract 
on a systematic basis consistent with the 
pattern of the transfer of services to which 
the asset relates, that is; as and when the 
relevant performance obligation is fulfilled for a 
given month.
(l) Expenditure
The expenses are recognised on an accrual 
basis. All expenses incurred in the ordinary 
course of business and in maintaining property, 
plant and equipment in a state of efficiency is 
charged against income in arriving at the profit 
for the year .
(m) Lease payments 
Minimum lease payments made under finance 
leases are apportioned between the finance 
expense and the reduction of the outstanding 
liability. The finance expense is allocated to 
each period during the lease term so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability. 
Contingent lease payments are accounted for 
by revising the minimum lease payments over 
the remaining term of the lease when the lease 
adjustment is confirmed. Determining whether 
an arrangement contains a lease.
At inception of an arrangement, the Group 
determines whether such an arrangement is or 
contains a lease. A specific asset is the subject 
of a lease if fulfillment of the arrangement 
is dependent on the use of that specific 
asset. An arrangement conveys the right to 
use the asset if the arrangement conveys to 
the Group the right to control the use of the 
underlying asset. 
(n) Finance income and expenses
The Group’s finance income and finance 
cost include:
 z Interest income from repurchase 
agreements
 z Interest income from fixed deposits
 z Staff loan interest income
 z Interest expense from borrowings
 z Interest expense arising from Leases
 z Foreign exchange gains or losses
Interest income or expense is recognised 
using the effective interest method. Dividend 
income is recognised in profit or loss on the 
date on which the Group’s right to receive 
payment is established.
(o) Income tax
Current income tax assets are measured at 
amount to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities
(i) Current taxation
Income tax expense comprises current 
and deferred tax. Income tax expense is 
recognised or profit or loss except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity, in which case it is recognised 
in equity or other comprehensive income.
Provisions for taxation is based on the profit 
for the year adjusted for taxation purposes 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 and the 
amendments thereto.
(ii) Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not 
recognised for the following temporary 
differences; 
– The initial recognition of assets or liabilities 
in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and that affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss and 
differences relating to investments in 
nor taxable profit or loss and differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries to 
the extent that it is probable that they will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
– Deferred tax is not recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on the initial 
recognition of goodwill.   
     
   
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, based on the 
laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are offset if there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
liabilities and assets, and they relate to income 
taxes levied by the same tax authority on the 
same taxable entity or on different tax entities, 
but they intend to settle current tax liabilities 
and assets on a net basis or their tax assets 
liabilities will be realised simultaneously. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred 
tax is not recognised for the undistributed 
profits of subsidiaries as the Parent Company 
has control over the dividend policy of its 
subsidiaries and distribution of those profits. 
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date and are reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised 
outside profit or loss, is recognised either in 
other comprehensive income or directly in 
Statement of Changes in Equity in line with the 
underlying transaction.
(iii) Social Security Contribution 
Levy (SSCL)
According to the Social Security Contribution 
Levy Act No. 25 of 2022, Sri Lanka T elecom 
PLC is liable for Social Security Contribution 
Levy at 2.5% on the liable turnover arising 
from providing of a service with effect from 
01 October 2022.
(iv) Sales tax
Revenue, expenses and assets are 
recognised net of the amount of sales 
tax, except: where sales tax incurred on 
a purchase of assets or services is not 
recoverable from the taxation authority, in 
which case the sales tax is recognised as 
part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or 
as part of expense item as applicable.
(v) Uncertainty over income tax 
treatment
The Group determines whether to consider 
each uncertain tax treatment separately or 
together with one or more other uncertain tax 
treatments and uses the approach that better 
predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.
IntroductionExecutive StatementsBusiness Context and 
Strategy
Business/ProsperityEnvironmentSocialGovernanceFinancial ReportsSupplementary 
Information
 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 141
The Group applies significant judgment 
in identifying uncertainties over income 
tax treatments and it assessed whether 
the interpretation had an impact on its 
consolidated Financial Statements.
If the Group concludes that it is probable 
that the taxation authority will accept the tax 
treatment used or planned to be used in its tax 
fillings, the entity determines its tax position 
on that basis. This is consistent with the 
requirement that current tax is measured at 
the amount expected to be paid or recovered 
from the taxation authorities, and that 
deferred tax is measured using the rates and 
tax laws expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or liability is settled.
If the Group concludes that acceptance of 
the uncertain tax treatment by the taxation 
authorities is not probable, it would apply one 
of the following two methods for reflecting 
the effect of uncertainty in its estimate of the 
amount it expects to pay or recover from the 
tax authorities
a. the most likely amount - the single most 
likely amount in a range of possible 
outcomes; or
b. the expected value - the sum of the 
probability-weighted amounts in a range 
of possible outcomes.
The Group uses the method that is expects 
to better predict the resolution of the 
uncertainty.
(p) Earnings Per Share 
The Group presents basic Earnings Per Share 
(EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the 
company by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting 
the profit or loss attributable to ordinary 
shareholders and the weighted-average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding for the 
effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
(q) Insurance reserve
SL T has Property All Risk Insurance for 
targeted assets of the SL T at island wide 
locations. In order to cover the exposure 
of remaining assets and possible further 
exposure LKR 300 Million has been retained 
in the insurance reserve. There are no further 
contributions to the insurance fund due to the 
reason of annual renewal of Property All Risk 
policy of SL T . 
(r) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s 
shareholders is recognised as a liability in the 
Group’s Financial Statements in the period 
in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
Provision for final dividends is recognised at 
the time the dividend recommended and 
declared by the Board of Directors, is approved 
by the shareholders.
(s) Comparatives
Except when a standard permits or requires 
otherwise, comparative information is 
disclosed in respect of the previous period. 
Where the presentation or classification 
of items in the Financial Statements are 
amended, comparative amounts are 
reclassified unless it is impracticable.
(t) Statement of cash flows
The Statement of Cash Flows has been 
prepared using the ‘indirect method’ of 
preparing cash flows in accordance with the 
Sri Lanka Accounting Standard (LKAS 07) – 
“Statement of Cash Flows” . Cash and Cash 
equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and are subject to 
an insignificant risk of change in value. The 
cash and cash equivalent include cash in hand, 
balances with banks, placements with banks, 
money at call and short notice.
(u) Critical accounting estimates, 
assumptions and judgements
In the preparation of these Financial 
Statements, a number of estimates and 
assumptions have been made relating to the 
performance and the financial position of the 
Group. Results may differ significantly from 
those estimates under different assumptions 
and conditions. The Directors consider 
that the following discussion addresses the 
Company’s most critical accounting policies, 
which are those that are most important to 
the presentation of its financial performance 
and position. These particular policies require 
subjective and complex judgements, often as 
a result of the need to make estimates about 
the effect of matters that are uncertain. 
(i) Depreciation of property, plant 
and equipment
The Company assigns useful lives and residual 
values to property, plant and equipment based 
on periodic studies of actual asset lives and 
the intended use for those assets. Changes 
in circumstances such as technological 
advances, prospective economic utilisation 
and physical condition of the assets concerned 
could result in the actual useful lives or residual 
values differing from initial estimates.
Where the Company determines that the 
useful life of property, plant and equipment 
should be shortened or residual value 
reduced, it depreciates the net carrying 
amount in excess of the residual value over 
the revised remaining useful life, thereby 
increasing depreciation expense. Any 
change in an asset’s life or residual value 
is reflected in the Company’s Financial 
Statements when the change in estimate 
is determined. 
(ii) Impairment of property, plant 
and equipment and intangible 
assets
The Company assesses the impairment of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable or otherwise 
as required by accounting standards. Factors 
that are considered important and which 
could trigger an impairment review include 
the following;
a. obsolescence or physical damage;
b. significant changes in technology and 
regulatory environments;
c. significant underperformance relative to 
expected historical or projected future 
operating results;
d. significant changes in the use of its assets 
or the strategy for its overall business;
The identification of impairment indicators, 
the estimation of future cash flows and the 
determination of the recoverable amount 
for assets or cash generating units require 
significant judgement. 
(iii) Revenue recognition
Judgement is required in assessing the 
application of the principles of revenue 
recognition in respect of revenues. This 
includes presentation of revenue as principal 
or as agent in respect of income received 
from transmission of content provided by 
third parties.
(iv) Valuation of receivables 
The provision for impairment losses for trade 
and other receivables reflects the Company’s 
estimates of losses arising from the failure 
or inability of customers to make required 
payments. The provision is based on the 
ageing of customer accounts, customer 
Notes to the Financial Statements
142 Sri Lanka T elecom PLC – Annual Report 2023 
credit-worthiness and the Company’s 
historical write-off experience etc. Changes 
to the provision may be required if the 
financial condition of its customers improves 
or deteriorates. An improvement in financial 
condition may result in lower actual write-offs.
(v) Inventories
The Company assesses the inventory 
provision whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable or otherwise 
as required by accounting standards. Factors 
that are considered important and which 
could trigger an impairment review include 
the following;
a. obsolescence or physical damage;
b. significant changes in technology and 
regulatory environments;
c. significant changes in the use of its assets 
or the strategy for its overall business;
(vi) Current tax and deferred tax
Judgement was required to determine the 
total provision for current, deferred and 
other taxes due to uncertainties that exist 
with respect to the interpretation of the 
applicability of tax law at the time of the 
preparation of these Financial Statements.
Certain uncertainties exist with respect to 
the interpretation of tax regulations and 
the amount and timing of future taxable 
income. Differences arising between the 
actual results and the assumptions made, or 
future changes to such assumptions, could 
necessitate future adjustments to tax income 
and expense already recorded. Where the 
final tax outcome of such matters is different 
from the amounts that were initially recorded, 
such differences will impact the income and 
deferred tax amounts in the period in which 
the determination is made.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, based on the 
laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date. 
(vii) Leases-Estimating the 
incremental borrowing rate
“The Group cannot readily determine the 
interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it 
uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to 
measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of 
interest that the Group would have to pay to 
borrow over a similar term, and with a similar 
security, the funds necessary to obtain an 
asset of a similar value to the right-of-use 
asset in a similar economic environment. 
The IBR therefore reflects what the Group 
“would have to pay” , which requires estimation 
when no observable rates are available or 
when they need to be adjusted to reflect the 
terms and conditions of the lease. The Group 
estimates the IBR using observable inputs 
such as market interest rates when available 
and is required to make certain entity-specific 
estimates as well.
(viii) Revenue recognition from 
contracts with customers
Judgement is required in assessing the 
application of the principles of revenue 
recognition in respect of revenues. 
Certain contracts with customers are 
bundled packages that may include sale 
of products and telecommunications 
services that comprise voice, data, and 
other telecommunications services. The 
Group accounts for individual products 
and services separately as separate 
performance obligations if they are distinct 
promised goods and services. The Group 
exercises judgements in determining 
whether a product is distinct, that is, if such 
product or service is separately identifiable 
from other items in the bundled package 
and if a customer can benefit from it 
separately. This determination will affect the 
allocation of consideration specified in the 
contract and the revenue recognised for 
each performance obligation.
(v) Amendments to existing 
accounting standards
The Group applied for the first-time certain 
standards and amendments, which are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2023. The Group has not early 
adopted any other standard, interpretation or 
amendment that has been issued but is not 
yet effective.
Definition of accounting estimates – 
Amendments to LKAS 8
The amendments to LKAS 8 clarify the 
distinction between changes in accounting 
estimates, changes in accounting policies 
and the correction of errors. They also 
clarify how entities use measurement 
techniques and inputs to develop 
accounting estimates. The amendments 
had no impact on the Group’s consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Amendments to LKAS 1: Classification 
of liabilities as current or non-current
Amendments to LKAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements specify the requirements 
for classifying liabilities as current or 
non-current. The amendments clarify;
 z What is meant by a right to defer settlement
 z That a right to defer must exist at the end of 
the reporting period
 z That classification is unaffected by the 
likelihood that an entity will exercise its 
deferral right
 z That only if an embedded derivative in 
a convertible liability is itself an equity 
instrument would the terms of a liability not 
impact its classification
 z Disclosure
The amendments had no impact on the 
Group’s consolidated Financial Statements.
Disclosure of accounting policies – 
Amendments to LKAS 1 and SLFRS 
Practice Statement 2
The amendments to LKAS 1 and SLFRS 
Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality 
Judgements provide guidance and examples 
to help entities apply materiality judgements to 
accounting policy disclosures.
The amendments aim to help entities provide 
accounting policy disclosures that are more 
useful by replacing the requirement for entities 
to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting 
policies with a requirement to disclose their 
‘material’ accounting policies and adding 
guidance on how entities apply the concept 
of materiality in making decisions about 
accounting policy disclosures.
“The amendments have had an impact 
on the Group’s disclosures of accounting 
policies, but not on the measurement, 
recognition or presentation of any items in 
the Group’s Financial Statements.
Deferred tax related to assets 
and liabilities arising from a Single 
T ransaction – Amendments to LKAS 12
The amendments to LKAS 12 Income T ax 
narrow the scope of the initial recognition 
exception, so that it no longer applies to 
transactions that give rise to equal taxable 
and deductible temporary differences such 
as leases and decommissioning liabilities. 
The amendments had no impact on the 
Group’s consolidated Financial Statements.

(w) Standards issued but not yet 
effective
There are no new accounting standards or 
amendments which are issued but not yet 
effective as at 31 December 2023 that are 
expected to have a material impact on the 
Group’s Financial Statements.
4. Financial Risk Management
The Board of Directors has overall 
responsibility for the establishment and 
oversight of the Group’s risk management 
framework.
The Group’s risk management processes 
are established to identify and analyse the 
risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate 
risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks 
and adherence to limits. Risk management 
systems are reviewed regularly to reflect 
changes in market conditions and the group 
activities.
The Audit Committee oversees how 
management monitors compliance with 
the Group’s risk management processes/
guidelines and procedures, and reviews 
the adequacy of the risk management 
framework in relation to the risks. The Audit 
Committee is assisted in its oversight role 
by internal reviews of risk management 
controls and procedures. The results of 
which are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Group has exposure to the following risks 
from its use of financial instruments:
– Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk
This note presents information about the 
Group’s exposure to each of the above 
risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing 
risk and the Group’s management of 
capital. Further quantitative disclosures 
are included throughout these Financial 
Statements.  
4.1. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to 
the Group if a customer or counterparty 
to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligation, and arise principally 
from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Carrying amount of financial assets represents 
the maximum credit exposure
As at 31 December , the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade by geographic region was as

Management believes that the past due more than one year are still collectible in full, based on 
historical payment behaviour and extensive analysis of customer credit risk.
4.1.1 T rade receivables
T o reduce credit risk, the Group has a 
well-established credit policy for both 
domestic and international interconnect 
customers. A separate committee has been 
established to assess and recommend 
the creditworthiness of the International 
Interconnect customer . Furthermore, prepaid 
sales are used to mitigate credit risk.
Domestic service is only offered to new 
customers after they have been screened 
through an internal blacklist database. The 
Group has a well-established credit control 
policy and process in place to reduce credit 
risk. Customers are divided into segments, 
and their credit limit is determined by the 
average monthly bill value. Customer usage 
and bill payments are monitored based on the 
credit limit. The credit limit will be adjusted 
periodically based on the previous month’s 
bill value. When high-risk voice customers 
reach the threshold limit, their service is 
automatically disconnected. Credit control 
and recovery actions are taken for overdue 
and defaulted customers to reduce credit 
risk. Customers with high revenue, including 
corporate customers, are individually 
monitored.

4.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will 
encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations 
associated with its financial liabilities that are 
settled by delivering cash or another financial 
asset. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that 
it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet 
its liabilities when due, under both normal 
and stressed conditions, without incurring 
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the 
Group’s reputation. 
The group ensures its liquidity is maintained 
by investing in short, medium and long-term 
financial instruments to support operational 
and other funding requirements. The group 
determines its liquidity requirements by 
the use of both short and long-term cash 
forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented 
by a financial headroom analysis which is used 
to assess funding adequacy for at least a 
12-month period and the same is reviewed on 
an annual basis. 
Short and medium-term requirements are 
regularly reviewed and managed by the 
T reasury Division.

4.3 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures 
within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
4.3.1 Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on services provided, services received and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the 
Sri Lankan rupees (LKR)  
The Group manages its currency risk by a natural hedging mechanism to a certain extent by matching currency outflows for repayments of foreign 
currency loans and services with currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies.
Further SL T uses forward bookings where necessary to mitigate their foreign currency exposure in a prudent manner .
The summary of quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to foreign currency was as follows:

4.3.2 Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk mainly arises as a result of Group having interest sensitive assets and liabilities, which are directly, impacted by changes in the interest 
rates. The Group’s borrowings and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest rate instruments and periodical maturity gap 
analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse impact due to volatility of the interest rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operations while long-term interest rate management decisions require approval 
from the board of Directors.
Interest rate sensitivity of the company was computed within the floor interest rate (Minimum) of 2.5% as stipulated in the loan agreement. The 
Group interest rate sensitivity was computed based on a 100 basis point increase or decrease. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in 
particular , foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The sensitivity of interest rate movement is shown below:

14. Right-of-use Assets and Lease Liabilities
The Group has lease contracts for various items of land and Buildings, E1 Links and towers used in its operations. Leases of land and Buildings 
generally have lease terms between 1 to 2 years while Leases of towers generally have lease terms between 2 to 3 years. The Group’s obligations 
under its leases are secured by the lessor’s title to the leases assets. Generally the Group is restricted from assigning and sub leasing the 
leased assets.         
The Group also has certain leases of towers or tower spaces with low value.
(a)  On 1 September 1991, the 
Department of T elecommunications 
(DoT) transferred its entire 
telecommunications business and 
related assets and liabilities to SL T . A 
valuation of the assets and liabilities 
transferred to SL T was performed by 
the Government of Sri Lanka. The net 
amount of those assets and liabilities 
represents SL T’s Contributed Capital on 
incorporation and the value of property, 
plant and equipment as determined by 
the Government of Sri Lanka. Valuers 
were used to determine the opening 
cost of fixed assets on 01 September 
1991 in the first statutory accounts 
of SL T . Further , SL T was converted 
into a public limited company, 
Sri Lanka T elecom Limited (SL TL), on 
25 September 1996 and on that date, 
all business and the related assets and 
liabilities of SL T were transferred to SL TL 
as part of the privatisation process.
(b) The cost of fully depreciated assets 
still in use in the company as at 
31 December 2023 was LKR 152,423, Mn. 
(2022 - LKR 155,164 Mn.). The cost of 
fully depreciated assets still in use in the 
Group as at 31 December 2023 was

(c) No assets have been mortgaged or 
pledged as security for borrowings of the 
Group.
(d) The number of buildings of the Group as at 
31 December 2023, is 1,266 (2022 -1,239)
(e) All the motor vehicles have been 
insured. SL T has obtained Property 
All Risk Insurance with effect from 
31 March 2022 for targeted assets 
of SL T at island wide locations. An 
insurance reserve has been created 
together with a sinking fund investment 
to meet any potential losses with 
regard to uninsured property, plant 
and equipment. At the reporting date, 
the insurance reserve amounted to 
LKR 300 Mn. (2022 - LKR 300 Mn.)  
(Note 28).
(f) Impairment of assets mainly consists 
of the carrying value of L TE Assets 
LKR 320 Mn., IT Systems LKR 69 Mn. 
and IPTV assets LKR 91 Mn. (2022 
- LKR 304 Mn. on L TE Assets and 
LKR 5 Mn. on CDMA towers). The 
impaired assets are related to the fixed 
telephony operations segment. The 
recoverable amount of these assets was 
computed based on the Value-In-Use 
method at a discount rate of 12% (2022 
- 19.50%). These impairment losses 
are included under the administrative 
expenses in the Statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income. 
(g) The capital work-in-progress related 
to network equipment of the Group is 
LKR 22,209 Mn. (2022 - LKR 22,959 Mn.)

amounting to LKR 4,286 Mn. during the 
year (2022 - LKR 3,961 Mn.). Borrowing 
cost capitalised from a Group perspective

relating to the relevant operating segments. No impairment charge has been recognised for the year ended 31 December 2023 for the above CGU 
(2022 - LKR Nil)

2023
%
2022
%
Discount rate (long-term) 13.0-14.0 18.2 -18.0 13.0 18.0

Retirement age of the employees - Y ears 55-60 55-60 55-60 55-60
In addition to above, demographic assumptions such as mortality, withdrawal, retirement age were considered for the actuarial valuation. 
In 2023,1967/70 Mortality T able issued by the Institute of Actuaries London (2022 - 1967/70 Mortality T able) was taken as the base for 
the valuation. 
The provisions for defined obligations of Sri Lanka T elecom PLC,SL T Digital info services (Private) Limited, Sri Lanka T elecom (Services) Limited, 
SL T Visioncom (Private) Limited, T alent fort (Private) Limited and Mobitel (Private) Limited, are actuarially valued by Messrs Actuarial and 
Management Consultants (Private) Limited and Messrs Piyal S Goonetilleke and Associates respectively.
The provision for defined benefit obligations is not externally funded. 
Sensitivity analysis
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have 
affected the defined benefit obligation by the amount shown below.
The sensitivity of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position is the effect of the 
assumed changes in discount rate and salary increment rate as depicted in the following table.

lastly due to the short-term maturities of these investments.
Fair value of trade and other payables and borrowings have been arrived by discounting gross values by the year end AWFDR rate.

35. Fair Value Disclosure (Contd...)
Fair value of financial assets and 
liabilities not carried at fair value
The following describes the methodologies 
and assumptions used to determine fair values 
of those financial instruments which are not 
already recorded at fair value in the Financial 
Statements.
Assets for which fair value 
approximates carrying value
Financial assets and liabilities that have a 
short-term maturity, it is assumed that the 
carrying amounts approximate their fair values. 
Fixed rate financial instruments
The fair Value of fixed rate financial assets 
and liabilities carried at amortised cost are 
estimated by comparing market interest rates 
when they were first recognised with current 
market rates for similar financial instruments
Variable rate financial instruments
Variable rate is a fair measure which reflects 
market movements. Hence the carrying value 
represents the fair value of the variable rate 
instruments.
36. Events After the

the subsidiaries
