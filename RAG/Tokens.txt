 Annual Report 2021 | 17
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to report that Sri Lanka 
Telecom Group recorded a stellar 
performance delivering earnings 
growth of 54% to Rs.12.2 Bn in 
2021. Its balance sheet strengthened 
recording asset growth of 8% to 
Rs.220 Bn and equity growth of 11% 
to 93.9 Bn in 2021. More importantly, 
its relevance to the country’s 
socioeconomic progress continues to 
grow as we reach more subscribers 
with our unified brand value 
proposition while fulfilling our role as 
a catalyst for the digital transformation 
of the country at individual and 
enterprise levels. 
On the negative side, the super gain 
tax proposed by the government 
will dent our profitability and cash 
flows. Nevertheless, as a responsible 
corporate we shall bear this in the 
hope it will help tide over the critical 
economic issues faced by the nation.   
A SUCCESS STORY
Sri Lanka Telecom is the success 
story for privatization in the state 
sector. It has recorded strong growth 
in earnings post privatization while 
expanding its pivotal role in the 
digital evolution of the country. Listed 
in CSE with a govt holding of not 
more than 49.5%, we are currently 
in discussions for further dilution of 
equity as specified under listing rules 
to meet main board requirements. SLT 
market capitalisation of over Rs.70 Bn 
representing approximately 1.5% of 
the market capitalisation of the CSE is 
backed by a strong domestic franchise 
that has gained strength with the 
brand unification implemented  
in 2021.
In January 2020, we saw a company 
with immense potential, but its 
progress was obstructed in several 
areas. Staff unrest was at the top of 
the list with regular strikes and work 
stoppages leading to poor messaging 
to the customers especially, the 
corporate sector. There were also 
significant investments made but 
without the desired ROI. These 
were some of the key challenges 
the new Board addressed and took 
result-oriented steps to take SLT to 
a new era of growth and resource 
optimisation. The excellent financial 
results posted this year is the success 
of these deliberations during 2021.
A BLUEPRINT FOR GROWTH
The outcome of the first board 
meeting was a blueprint for unlocking 
value to realise the potential of this 
nationally significant institution. I am 
happy to see that the early initiatives 
implemented in 2020 stabilised the 
company and enabled its move to 
the top of the ladder in 2021. The 
consolidation of Group companies 
under a Group CEO in 2020, was 
further enhanced with all main 
functions of HR, Finance, Legal and 
Brand Marketing being brought under 
the group umbrella for a unified and 
focused strategic direction. 
The unified brand SLT-MOBITEL 
launched on the first working day of 
January 2021 was key to unlocking 
value and realizing Group synergies. 
We were able to achieve this in a cost-
effective manner as it was done within 
the process of the advertising pitch 
presented by all reputed advertising 
agencies in Sri Lanka. By channelling 
the entire group advertising through 
one agency after a successful pitch, we 
were able to manage costs effectively. 
The core principles, zero corruption, 
minimum wastage, maximum 
efficiency and inclusive management 
the new Board introduced in the 
beginning of 2020, are now firmly 
embedded in the governance code 
of operations. These helped in 
building confidence between the 
staff and the management and the 
adoption of new strategies. These 
critical changes made Sri Lanka 
Telecom the most powerful player 
in the telecommunications sector 
in the country with the broadest 
presence across the value chain 
and unparalleled capacity to meet 
the needs of up-and-coming tech 
companies, large corporates, general 
public and the state institutions.
UNLOCKING VALUE
Sri Lanka Telecom is an asset rich 
company with a fast majority in 
Property Plant & Equipment, In 
addition to considerable investments 
in technology. SLT real estate portfolio 
listed in the Annual Report is being 
reviewed for monetizing through 
strategic partnerships. The Company 
is confident of a good revenue from 
this exercise and hopes to create a 
new revenue line of approximately 
500 million per annum soon. 
The brand unification launched in in 
the beginning of 2021 supported the 
“One stop shop” concept which is 
now being implemented throughout 
the country. This enabled the Group 
to save rental expenses through the 
consolidation of operations under 
one roof. It also showcased the full 
spectrum of services and devices and 
enhanced the customer experience. 
For the next level of customer 
convenience, we are focusing on bill 
convergence for which approval from 
the Telecom Regulatory Commission 
is awaited. Additionally, the role out 
of 5G technology will be available for 
experience in selected outlets. 
UPHOLDING TRUST
Sri Lanka Telecom upheld the 
country’s trust during the past two 
years as we all navigated perhaps 
the most challenging period in living 
memory. As the pandemic changed 
the way we work, learn and live, 
telecommunication was the lifeline for 
those who were sick, in quarantine or 
in need of comfort. Despite the health 
and safety challenges to our teams 
and the business disruptions, Sri Lanka 
Telecom upheld the trust of an entire 
nation providing an uninterrupted 
service and supporting the migration 
of thousands of businesses and 
people to digital platforms. It is hard 
to think of how we, as a nation, could 
have managed to maintain even the 
subdued levels of economic activity 
since the pandemic without this iconic 
company upholding its promise. 
The leadership strategized to 
overcome the multiple challenges and 
our field staff worked in the front lines 
at considerable risk to provide new 
connections and address complaints, 
all united by a sense of purpose. 
Throughout this period, our staff 
remained motivated and national 
minded while effective engagement 
with trade unions supported business 
continuity throughout this critical 
period. It is important to note that 
we maintained our prices throughout 
18 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
this period to ensure that our services 
remained affordable to our customers, 
making Sri Lanka one of the cheapest 
countries for telecommunication 
services.
We needed to rewrite the book 
on managing the pandemic as we 
continued to be dogged by variants 
and waves in 2021 despite extensive 
vaccinations. Cybersecurity was a key 
concern as we also had a threat on 
ransomware. Managing these twin 
threats made business continuity 
planning a priority and significant 
time and resources were allocated 
to strengthening our defenses and 
response mechanisms. A vigilance 
committee was established which met 
weekly to assess the situation and 
address the issues. Sri Lanka Telecom 
upheld its trust with its employees as 
we implemented several measures 
for their safety and that of their 
families. Our holiday bungalows were 
converted to quarantine facilities 
for staff and their families. We also 
booked space at specialised care 
centres managed by hospitals for 
employees who needed additional 
care. We also provided dry rations 
for employees who tested positive 
and their families. A Group wide 
campaign to vaccinate our staff 
enabled us to get 90% of our staff 
vaccinated with two doses and now 
the booster is being administered 
to safeguard them. Employees also 
had access to medical advice through 
our e-channelling service. Sri Lanka 
Telecom was the first to contribute 
to the COVID fund as well. We are 
now able to move forward as a more 
resilient Group with an enhanced 
employee value proposition and 
the readiness to meet unforeseen 
challenges.
INTEGRATING ESG
Sri Lanka Telecom is committed to 
integrating ESG best practices into its 
business model, making it an essential 
part of our operating structure. A 
large energy bill provides strong 
motivation to formulate a holistic, 
long-term response and we will 
continue to seek solutions to reduce 
our energy consumption. Expansion 
of our fiber network coverage will 
support a decrease in our carbon 
footprint and reduce the MSAN 
impact. Solar, wind, hydro and other 
renewable energy options are being 
evaluated to facilitate our transition to 
low carbon and renewable sources of 
energy. 
SLT commenced its campaign to 
plant Mee trees (Madhuca Longifolia) 
islandwide under the ESG protocols 
to improve environment, empower 
underprivileged villages and govern 
the program through KPI’s including 
geo tagging the plants and their 
ownership. Mee is an indigenous tree 
with natural pest control properties 
and contributes to fertilizing the 
soil and purifying the air. It is a 
historically significant tree as etched 
in our ancient stone tablets. This is 
an example of our commitment to 
finding sustainable solutions through 
knowledge, nature and science 
aligned with our culture and heritage. 
The campaign will run over a few 
years and expand to other valuable 
tree species with an aim of exceeding 
million plants and earn carbon credit 
for the Company.
Integration of ESG into our systems 
and processes and the work culture 
rallies all to work beyond profit. Sri 
Lanka Telecom plays a key role in 
inclusive progress for all Sri Lankans 
as connectivity empowers them 
to access a host of services and 
improve their lifestyle. Connecting 
rural villages through the “Gamata 
Sannivedanaya” programme is an 
example of our vision of empowering 
Sri Lankans to participate effectively 
in the socioeconomic progress of our 
country. Other social aspects include 
providing digital access to health and 
other common services especially 
the “connect schools” program 
through our fibre optic backbone 
for uninterrupted connectivity for 
advanced education as an alternative 
to tuition. 
NAVIGATING 2022 & BEYOND
The fragile global economic recovery 
observed in 2021 received a body 
blow with the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine in March 2022. Locally, 
the country continues to struggle 
with the foreign exchange liquidity 
Sri Lanka Telecom plays 
a key role in inclusive 
progress for all Sri 
Lankans as connectivity 
empowers them to 
access a host of services 
and improve their 
lifestyle. Connecting 
rural villages through the 
“Gamata Sannivedanaya” 
programme is an 
example of our vision of 
empowering Sri Lankans 
to participate effectively 
in the socioeconomic 
progress of our country.
GROUP CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE
 Annual Report 2021 | 19
crisis and sharp devaluation of the 
rupee in March 2022 as looming 
debt repayments continue to hinder 
economic progress. It has also 
triggered a potential energy crisis 
which is a growing concern. Rising 
inflation which is a global issue 
is amplified in the local context, 
exacerbating the challenges ahead. 
We are cautiously optimistic that 
the pandemic is nearing endemicity, 
although we remain on high alert for 
developments around the world.
Our relevance to customers increased 
as we transformed from a telephone 
company to a tech company that 
is a catalyst for Sri Lanka’s digital 
transformation. We are excited about 
delivering the future today as we 
connect people with fiber network to 
their homes, creating safe wi-fi zones 
to supporting a future fit lifestyle. 
In 2021, we established “The 
Embryo”, our own research and 
development arm which stems from 
the infusion of yin and yang to give 
life to ideas. Under this, we provide 
facilities to start up tech companies 
and our own innovators who will 
develop coding and applications. 
A number of projects have been 
undertaken by “The Embryo” and we 
will see new products coming out of 
this in 2022 which will enhance our 
product range to customers and new 
applications and coding to improve 
our own systems. These innovations 
will transform our houses to smart 
homes with hither to unknown 
features. This will deliver services such 
as medical consultations, security, 
entertainment, education and also 
empower people to work and transact 
from the comfort of their homes 
facilitating a new era of smart living, 
Although we delivered reliable Wi-
Fi despite the upsurge in demand 
during the pandemic period, one of 
our issues has been the speed. This 
is being addressed by increasing 
the bandwidth with an investment 
of US$ 50 Mn from our own funds in 
a new under the sea cable together 
with a consortium of 16 telecom 
companies in the region to improve 
broadband and data services. The 
increased capacity will support the 
growth of data centres, supporting 
new employment opportunities in the 
country.
We are also enhancing our data 
centres and transforming them to data 
farms, encouraging corporates to use 
our data servers as opposed to the 
current model of operating their own 
server rooms which is an expensive 
solution. Our data farms will enable 
these corporates to reduce the cost of 
operations while retaining control over 
their information assets. This will be a 
key campaign for Sri Lanka Telecom 
in 2022.
Sri Lanka Telecom will also leverage 
its Group strength through a Group 
Treasury function to manage Group 
cashflows, reduce interest rates and 
strengthen the Group’s financial 
resilience with zero debt by 2023. We 
are pleased that we are very much on 
course towards this goal with stringent 
financial management and optimized 
use of assets.
We had a change in leadership at 
Mobitel in 2021 as Mr. Chandika 
Vithanage took over the reins. There 
was a change in leadership at Sri 
Lanka Telecom in February 2022 as 
well with Mr. Janaka Abeysinghe 
taking over as the Chief Executive. A 
new COO is also designated to take 
over in July 2022. These changes 
will also support new ideas and 
development of new capabilities 
across the Group.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
All of the above would not have 
been possible without the willing 
cooperation of key stakeholders. The 
management and the employees of 
the Sri Lanka Telecom Group have set 
an example to all utility companies 
in the country as they worked 
throughout the difficult times without 
unfair demands demonstrating the 
commitment to serve the nation and 
its people at a critical time. The Board 
joins me in commending their efforts 
and thanking them for their unstinted 
support. 
Effective leadership is a sine qua 
non for sustained growth integrating 
ESG at its core. I am grateful for the 
commitment of the Board of Directors, 
for their cooperation in this regard 
and for their support in driving the 
changes required to transform Sri 
Lanka Telecom into a resilient future 
forward technology company that can 
lead Sri Lanka trough the 5th industrial 
revolution.
All of this is possible due to a loyal 
customer base that continues to 
trust Sri Lanka Telecom for inclusion 
in the socioeconomic progress of 
the country as we empower them to 
connect locally to global opportunities 
for learning, earning and innovating. 
The Board, our teams and I are 
committed to paving the way to 
empower our customers through a 
growing portfolio of products and 
services that will support their lifestyle 
and career aspirations, taking Sri 
Lanka to a new era of growth.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER’S MESSAGE
Sri Lanka Telecom 
Group delivered a 
strong performance 
with topline growth of 
12.3% year on year to 
Rs.102.3 Bn boosted 
by 16% growth in fixed 
telephony operations 
and 9% growth in mobile 
operations.
The cornerstone of the Group’s strategy was the SLT-Mobitel brand unification which 
supported realisation of significant group synergies and the positioning of the Group as the 
National ICT solution services provider. 
 Annual Report 2021 | 21
Dear Stakeholders,
REFLECTIONS ON 2021
Digital transformation across the 
world accelerated with the onset of 
the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 
continued to gather momentum in 
2021. Sri Lanka Telecom has been at 
the forefront of the country’s digital 
transformation, supporting people, 
businesses and government entities 
migrate to digital platforms for a 
growing number of applications. As 
the pandemic continued to disrupt 
economic activity in 2021 as well, 
digital platforms continued to keep 
people connected and entertained 
while supporting learning and working 
from home, significantly minimising 
its impact. Several key industries 
including banks, hospitals, the retail 
and food industries accelerated digital 
empowerment of their customers 
which supported the surge in 
e-commerce and online transactions 
in 2021 facilitating enhanced 
customer satisfaction. These initiatives 
led to significant progress of the 
Government’s vision for a digital  
Sri Lanka. 
Sri Lanka Telecom continued to invest 
in upgrading its infrastructure, paving 
the way for Sri Lanka’s integration 
into the global marketplace and the 
5th industrial revolution that we are 
living through. We are expanding our 
fibre and 5G technology networks to 
support higher speeds for all. With 
the brand unification, we focused 
on delivering integrated solutions 
combining the wide range of 
services provided by both Sri Lanka 
Telecom and Mobitel to provide total 
solutions for individual and corporate 
customers. Our integrated enterprise 
solutions are unparalleled supporting 
growth of the country’s vital IT sector 
which is key to its socioeconomic 
progress. Our investments in the  
SEA-ME-WE cables have been the 
gateway to the country’s integration 
with the world and we are now 
investing in our 6th cable enhancing 
capacity and speed which will be 
commissioned in 2022. 
A commitment to drive growth 
without corruption and waste in 
an inclusive manner supported 
the Sri Lanka Telecom Group to 
overcome significant challenges in 
2021 and increase the efficiency of 
our operations. We anticipated the 
evolution of technology before it 
transformed, and we were future 
ready in terms of infrastructure 
developments for the modern 
technology. SLT-MOBITEL now clearly 
poised as the National ICT solution 
services provider, reinforcing our 
strengths to provide an unmatched 
value proposition to individuals and 
corporates of all sizes.
GROUP STRATEGY AND VISION
The cornerstone of the Group’s 
strategy was the SLT-Mobitel brand 
unification which supported realisation 
of significant group synergies and 
the positioning of the Group as the 
National ICT solution services provider. 
These include the ability to offer 
seamlessly integrated solutions to 
customers, strengthening customer 
service and driving significant cost 
efficiencies in a number of areas. It 
also eliminated confusion of brands by 
customers who are now able to obtain 
the full range of solutions under one 
roof. 
We also divested non-core businesses 
to concentrate on our core 
businesses which has supported our 
performance during the year as we 
are now realizing the benefits through 
improved focus and productivity. 
Further, the clear definition of metrics 
and goals supported oversight 
and performance management, 
synchronizing activities towards 
organisation goals. These initiatives 
supported the SLT Group to record 
the highest turnover in its entire 
history while maintaining prices 
and ensuring that access to Wi-Fi 
remained affordable with attractively 
priced Work From Home (WFH) and 
Work From POD (WFP) packages to 
support people through the pandemic 
years.
Sri Lanka Telecom was ranked 
among the Top Ten in the country’s 
prestigious Best Corporate Citizen 
Sustainability Awards in 2021 and was 
also the winner of the Other category. 
Our efforts to support the nation 
during the pandemic were recognised 
with an award for demonstrating 
resilient practices during this period 
at the same award programme 
organised by the Ceylon Chamber of 
Commerce. 
DELIVERING PERFORMANCE
Sri Lanka Telecom Group delivered 
a strong performance with topline 
growth of 12.3% year on year to 
Rs.102.3 Bn boosted by 16% growth 
in fixed telephony operations and 
9% growth in mobile operations. 
Profit After Tax growth of 54.3% to 
Rs.12.2 Bn was largely attributable 
to the enhanced profitability of 
mobile operations which increased 
by 63.8% to Rs. 8 Bn accounting for 
66% of Group Profits after tax while 
profitability from fixed telephony 
operations increased by 46% to  
Rs. 5.9 Bn accounting for the balance. 
EBITDA of the Group grew at 16.1% 
to Rs. 41.17 Bn supporting a high 
level of liquidity and strong cashflow 
generation.
Group profits were propelled forward 
by robust performances by multiple 
business segments, improving 
financial resilience through improved 
diversification of revenues. 2021 
saw a surge in broadband revenues 
supported by increased connections 
and usage. Revenue growth in PEO 
TV was also encouraging as more 
consumers sought broader menus for 
entertainment. We also strengthened 
our value proposition to global 
businesses with Xyntac, the Group’s 
evolving digital communications 
ecosystem that has the capability 
to provide transport speeds upto 
multiple speeds of 100 Gbps through 
ownership of major submarine cable 
systems and partner cable systems. 
Financial resilience was further 
improved with the decrease of 
Rs.8.5 Bn in borrowings during the 
year under review which was also 
supported by an increase of 11% in 
equity to Rs.93.9 Bn. Accordingly, 
the debt equity ratio improved from 
78.2% in 2020 to 66.1% in 2021. 
Liquidity of the Group also improved 
as operating cashflows recorded an 
increase of 35% to Rs.43.6 Bn. We 
invested Rs.30 Bn in new technologies 
and enhancing our capabilities 
in 2021, a near doubling of the 
investments made in 2020 enhancing 
our revenue generation capabilities. 
22 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
Cash and cash equivalents at the close 
of the year increased by 63% to Rs.16 
Bn providing sufficient liquidity while 
the overall financial position provides 
sufficient headroom for pursuit of our 
strategic goals to drive sustainable 
growth in earnings. 
I am pleased to report that the market 
capitalisation of Sri Lanka Telecom 
PLC increased by 15.8% to Rs. 70 Bn  
during the reporting period, reflecting 
the shareholder value created in 2021. 
VALUE DELIVERED TO 
EMPLOYEES
People strategy was critical to 
alignment of employee and 
organisational objectives and to 
the realisation of synergies through 
the brand unification. The more 
inclusive and participative style of 
management adopted from 2020 with 
the absorption of outsourced staff into 
the permanent cadre worked well and 
the trade unions cooperated to ensure 
business continuity throughout the 
pandemic lockdown periods. In 2021, 
we enhanced the performance culture 
by introducing a performance based 
bonus linked to the performance 
management system, a supervisor 
peer evaluation system and a research 
and development platform to 
capture employee ideas, enhancing 
recognition and rewards. We also 
launched a Regional Awakening 
initiative to empower the regions 
under the General and Deputy 
General Managers to ensure that 
progress benefited those who served 
around the country as well. 
The holistic care program 
implemented for employees during 
the pandemic included the conversion 
of the three holiday homes into 
quarantine centres, reserving space 
with intermediary care centres and 
provision of dry rations for infected 
employees and their families. Capacity 
building has been a key area of focus 
with employees receiving 8 hours of 
training on average which we plan 
to increased to 12 in the coming 
year. A retention rate of 95% affirms 
the strength of our employee value 
proposition with many employees 
encouraging the next generation to 
join in as well.
FORMULATING OUR CLIMATE 
AGENDA
Sri Lanka Telecom commenced 
its journey towards becoming a 
carbon neutral organisation in 
2018. Phase I to assess the carbon 
footprint and obtain ISO certification 
has been completed and we are 
now in Phase II, which focuses on 
energy management and policy 
implementation. Several projects are 
being rolled out across the Group to 
mitigate carbon emissions as a unified 
brand. We are now in the process of 
setting up a timeframe with external 
consultants to reach our goal in 5 
years. Apart from this, we continue 
to increase awareness on the urgent 
need to preserve the environment and 
reduce environmental degradation. 
Minimising waste was a key dimension 
with initiatives to convert waste to 
cash supporting cost efficiencies. 
As the only provider of fibre-to-the-
home connectivity in Sri Lanka, we 
have begun replacing traditional 
copper cables with modern fibre optic 
cables for high speed internet across 
the country. We then completely 
repurpose those copper cables 
for traditional operations, reusing 
resources that would otherwise have 
been discarded as waste.  Mee Tree 
planting campaign is another project 
which will support offsetting carbon 
emissions and has the potential to 
create a revenue stream by generating 
carbon credits. A dedicated 
Power and energy department is 
implementing plans to diversify our 
energy sources through investments 
in renewable energy such as solar and 
biomass.  
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S MESSAGE
Sri Lanka Telecom is 
transforming from a 
Telecommunications 
company to a Technology 
company as we broaden 
the customer value 
propositions for different 
customer segments, 
delivering the future 
today. We will expand 
our 4G network beyond 
40% and also activate 5G 
in 2022. 
 Annual Report 2021 | 23
DELIVERING THE FUTURE
The increasing reliance on digital 
platforms to support lifestyles and 
how we do business underpins 
our plans for growth. Despite the 
uncertain economic landscape, there 
has been no abatement of the pace of 
technology evolution and we observe 
an acceleration as there is increasing 
acceptance and understanding of 
the benefits. Regulation of the sector 
continues to evolve and our position 
as a National ICT Provider ensures that 
we are engaged in the discussion and 
are cognizant of the multidimensional 
socioeconomic impacts of this rapidly 
evolving industry.
Sri Lanka Telecom is transforming from 
a Telecommunications company to a 
Technology company as we broaden 
the customer value propositions 
for different customer segments, 
delivering the future today. We will 
expand our 4G network beyond 40% 
and also activate 5G in 2022. Our fibre 
network will be expanded as well, 
using Fibre to the roof technology to 
ensure it is safe and a viable option. 
Investing in the SEA-ME-WE 6, the 
newest undersea able running across 
the globe will be key to improving 
global connectivity. Ensuring our 
customers are part of our journey is 
key and we are planning to introduce 
affordable 4G devices through our 
joint venture which will do local 
assembly.  
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Everyone played a part in delivering 
the outstanding performance set out 
in this report. I commence by thanking 
my team and the CEOs who led the 
teams to deliver on multifaceted 
strategies despite the challenges. 
I am also grateful for the direction 
and guidance provided by the Board 
which was available for counsel when 
needed. We thank the Sri Lanka 
Telecommunications Regulatory 
Commission who continued their 
collaborative and proactive approach 
to regulatory matters. In conclusion, I 
thank all our customers and business 
partners who all played a vital role in 
driving our growth in 2021 and look 
forward to sharing our journey with 
them.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE  
OFFICER’S MESSAGE
As an organisation, SLT adopted a holistic and strategic approach aligned to our aspiration 
of driving connectivity through three pillars, namely being a catalyst in Sri Lanka’s digital 
journey, strengthening global connectivity and investing for the future. 
Our people strategy 
focused on the key 
pillars of empowering 
our team, enhancing 
productivity and offering 
opportunities for training 
and career development. 
We also directed 
significant investments in 
supporting the well-being 
of our people through 
comprehensive health 
and safety measures.
Dear Stakeholders,
The pandemic has forever 
transformed what we believed to be 
‘normal’, compelling communities, 
organisations and individuals to 
move out of their comfort zones 
and adapt to unique opportunities 
and challenges. In these conditions, 
SLT successfully leveraged its voice 
and data capabilities to support the 
interconnectivity of people, playing 
a vital role in ensuring continued 
economic activity, education, and 
entertainment in the country. This 
purpose helped SLT navigate the 
unprecedented challenges of the 
past year, informing our strategy and 
effectively directing our responses, 
which in turn has enabled a strong 
triple bottom line performance during 
the year. 
DELIVERING OUR ASPIRATIONS
As an organisation, SLT adopted 
a holistic and strategic approach 
aligned to our aspiration of driving 
connectivity through three pillars, 
namely being a catalyst in Sri Lanka’s 
digital journey, strengthening global 
connectivity and investing for the 
future. 
 Annual Report 2021 | 25
Catalyst in Sri Lanka’s digital journey
SLT is aptly positioned to spearhead 
aspirations towards a Smart Sri Lanka, 
through a multi-pronged approach 
centering on digital government, 
digital economy, digital infrastructure 
and digital inclusivity. In 2021, 
our interventions were focused 
towards addressing the broad-
based implications of the pandemic, 
particularly on facilitating remote 
working, education, distribution and 
supply chains and entertainment. 
Accordingly, SLT played a vital role in 
ensuring the continuity of economic 
activity through providing the 
necessary technology infrastructure 
and offerings to facilitate work-from-
home, both in the Government and 
private sector. Meanwhile, our wide-
ranging partnerships with Government 
institutions enabled the uninterrupted 
provision of essential government 
services across the country, which in 
turn allowed the general public to 
avail these services despite pandemic-
led disruptions. A key achievement 
during the year, was SLT’s ability to 
facilitate the unpredicted transition 
to digital learning through unique 
platforms, free access and attractive 
data packages. Despite the financial 
and operational constraints posed 
by COVID-19, the Group adopted a 
long-term view to value creation and 
continued to invest in the upgrade 
and expansion of our network 
including FTTH. These investments 
are expected to accrue significant 
benefits to Sri Lankan businesses, 
households and the Government over 
the medium-to-long term, providing 
access to  speedy, secure, reliable 
and affordable connectivity. We also 
supported continuity of agricultural 
and other distribution chains through 
unique platforms such as Cochchi.lk 
and the Helaviru platform.
Strengthening Global connectivity
Despite the challenges that prevailed 
during the year, SLT continued 
to invest in expanding its global 
footprint, including our optical fibre 
submarine cable systems. During the 
year we directed investments towards 
a new international cable system as a 
consortium partner, with aim of further 
expanding our points of the presence 
across the globe. 
Investing for the future
Our established track record as Sri 
Lanka’s national ICT solutions provider 
has armed us with deep insights 
on the evolution of technology, 
which enables us to future-proof 
our business through investments in 
infrastructure and technology. These 
investments are centered on providing 
best-in-class coverage, speed, 
security, reliability and performance 
to our domestic and international 
customers. In 2021, we continued 
to direct significant investments 
towards further expanding the FTTH 
network, in line with our aspirations of 
delivering fibre broadband technology 
to 2 million households by 2023. SLT 
Mobitel also further developed its 4G 
network and trialed 5G technologies 
during the year while investing in 
new data centres and multi-cloud 
platforms. Key investments planned 
for 2022 include the optical fibre 
network, 4G network expansions with 
5G capabilities along with Mobitel,  
international cables, multi-cloud 
platform expansions and carrier 
neutral data centres. 
PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW 
The Company delivered a strong 
performance during the year, 
recording revenue growth of 16.0% 
to Rs.59.81 Bn and profit growth of 
45.9% to Rs. 5.87 Bn. Performance 
was upheld by the Company’s ability 
to swiftly cater to the unprecedented 
surge in demand for connectivity 
and speed, as reflected by the 
strong growth in broadband and 
data services. Despite a marginal 
decline in operating profitability, 
overall performance was upheld by 
strong dividend income from the 
Company’s subsidiaries. SLT also 
maintained financial resilience, with 
equity increasing by 5% led by good 
profitability and borrowings declining 
by 10%, resulting in the debt-to-
equity ratio improving from 0.77 to 
0.66 in 2021. 
OUR PEOPLE PROPOSITION
SLT continued to offer a unique value 
proposition to its +6,500 employees, 
who were a vital factor in facilitating 
connectivity and offering uninterrupted 
services to our customers. Our 
people strategy focused on the key 
pillars of empowering our team, 
enhancing productivity and offering 
opportunities for training and career 
development. We also directed 
significant investments in supporting 
the well-being of our people through 
comprehensive health and safety 
measures. The Company’s employee 
retention rate of around 95% during 
the year attests to the strength of its 
value proposition to employees, as 
we progress towards our aspiration of 
nurturing a dynamic and conducive 
environment for our team. 
WAY FORWARD
I firmly believe that improved 
secured and reliable connectivity is 
a vital tool in driving socio-economic 
empowerment and development. 
SLT has an important role to play in 
enabling this digital future and we are 
deeply committed to leveraging our 
capabilities, infrastructure and insights 
in propelling Sri Lanka towards the 
next phase of its digital growth. Our 
short-to-medium term aspiration is to 
fortify our market position across all 
domestic business verticals through 
further driving rural penetration and 
transforming the entire customer 
experience to improve service levels 
and retention. Key investments 
planned for 2022 include the optical 
fibre network, 4G network expansions 
with 5G capabilities along with 
Mobitel,  international cables, multi-
cloud platform expansions and carrier 
neutral data centres. The Company is 
also pursuing opportunities to unlock 
the value of its extensive landbank, 
through monetising these assets to 
fund expansion of our core business. 
We are cognisant of the inevitable 
short-to-medium term challenges 
arising from the country’s macro-
economic vulnerabilities and shortage 
in foreign currency which have made 
it difficult to import components, 
hardware and other infrastructure 
essential for expansion. Despite these 
risks, we are optimistic of the country’s 
revival over the medium-to-long 
term and as Sri Lanka’s national ICT 
solutions provider, will play a central 
role in propelling the country’s digital 
aspirations forward. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
As I look forward to an exciting year, I 
would like to extend my gratitude to 
the Chairman and Board of Directors for 
their guidance and valuable counsel. I 
also take this opportunity to thank each 
and every member of our team and our 
trade unions for their dedication and 
commitment in delivering the results 
set out in this Report despite extreme 
challenges. I also wish to thank all 
customers, business partners and other 
stakeholder who have partnered us in 
our journey and look forward to your 
continued support in the years to come. 
Thank you.

CHIEF OPERATING  
OFFICER’S REVIEW
Our people management strategy for the year centered on enhancing productivity and optimising 
human capital. With new recruitments limited for the year, focus was placed on empowering the 
team through providing access to technology tools, skill development and knowledge sharing. 
The Group’s success 
for the year was 
underpinned by its ability 
to swiftly embrace the 
new realities of the post-
pandemic world. As 
Sri Lanka experienced 
2nd and 3rd COVID-19 
waves, our foremost 
priority was ensuring 
the safety of our 
employees while rolling 
out our accelerated FTTH 
program. 
 Annual Report 2021 | 27
Dear Stakeholders,
Even though the pandemic of 
COVID 19 is a remaining tragedy 
for two consecutive years in Sri 
Lanka, as a Group, we managed to 
provide boundless and continuous 
services. SLT, the national ICT 
and Telecommunications service 
provider was called upon to lead 
the effort in transitioning to remote 
working, online education, virtual 
entertainment and keeping people 
connected. It was a responsibility we 
embraced with passion and integrity, 
and we are extremely proud of the 
unparalleled role we played during 
the year in facilitating Sri Lanka’s 
continued economic and social activity 
in these unprecedented times. 
The Group’s success for the year was 
underpinned by its ability to swiftly 
embrace the new realities of the 
post-pandemic world. As Sri Lanka 
experienced 2nd and 3rd COVID-19 
waves, our foremost priority was 
ensuring the safety of our employees 
while rolling out our accelerated FTTH 
program. The Group introduced an 
array of precautionary measures to 
minimise the risk of cross infection 
in line with the safety requirements 
recommended by local and global 
health authorities.  In addition to 
regular PCR testing and facilitating 
vaccinations, infected employees and 
their families were also given access to  
dedicated quarantine centres across 
the country. We also facilitated remote 
working in way of working from 
home, working from closest point to 
home and direct from home to field 
across the organisation, providing the 
relevant infrastructure and support for 
employees to deliver uninterrupted 
services.   
Our people management strategy 
for the year centered on enhancing 
productivity and optimising human 
capital. With new recruitments 
limited for the year, focus was placed 
on empowering the team through 
providing access to technology tools, 
skill development and knowledge 
sharing. We continued to invest in 
developing our talent and our training 
proposition for the year aimed to 
build a multi-skilled, future-proof 
talent pool. This approach enabled 
the Group to match employee 
competencies with the requirements 
of the job, thereby optimising our 
human capital. The commitment 
of our employees during these 
challenging times have been truly 
awe-inspiring, as they rallied behind 
our call to ensure uninterrupted 
services to customers across the 
country. 
Despite the uncertainty and turbulence 
that prevailed throughout the year, 
the Group adopted a long-term 
view to value creation, continuing to 
direct investments towards enhancing 
technology, connectivity and capacity. 
Key investments made during the 
year included expansion of the FTTH 
network, aligned with our aspirations 
of providing premium fibre broadband 
technology to 2 million households 
by 2023.  To date over 65,000km 
of fiber has been laid out, with a 
further 5000km expected in 2022. 
We enhanced our 4G network and 
started pre-commercial roll-out of our 
5G networks to offer fixed wireless 
and mobile broadband solutions. 
The Group also invested in new data 
centres and multi- cloud platforms 
during the year. Increased migration to 
cloud-based platforms and multimedia 
consumption led to unprecedented 
demand for bandwidth, which in turn 
required continued investments in 
expanding the core, broadband and IP 
networks. Given the increased demand 
on the international network, we also 
expanded our global footprint, which is 
facilitated through our submarine and 
undersea fibre optic cable systems. 
Through these investments, we 
hope to offer holistic services across 
all industry verticals and customer 
segments, including B2B, B2C  
and B2G. 
Disruptions to our supply chain 
remained a key challenge during the 
year, reflecting global shortages in 
components and the country’s foreign 
currency shortage. In addressing this 
challenge, the Group proactively 
sought to re-engineer processes 
while recovering and reconditioning 
selected input materials. We also 
ensured the effective management 
of inventories through lead-time 
controls and demand planning, 
which in turn enabled the Group to 
minimise stock-out situations. We 
have also driven efforts in expanding 
our local procurement, thereby 
providing local manufacturers the 
opportunity to expand capabilities 
and competencies. 
The unprecedented shift to digital 
platforms has led to a parallel increase 
in cybersecurity vulnerabilities, with 
data confidentiality, data manipulation 
and attacks by malicious actors 
emerging as key threats in the 
risk landscape. We have placed 
strategic focus on strengthening 
our cybersecurity defenses, through 
enhancing end-point detection and 
response systems and improving 
monitoring across all platforms. 
Vulnerability assessments, penetration 
testing and implementation of an 
internal security centre have also 
strengthened our defenses. As a result 
of these efforts, the Group was able 
to effectively manage its cybersecurity 
risks during the year, with no major 
incidents reported.
Following the strengthening of 
the Group’s quality management 
framework last year, we have 
continued to make inroads in 
improving our processes, enhancing 
workmanship, ensuring conformity to 
standards and promoting risk-based 
thinking. In 2021,we transitioned to 
a 100% testing system through an 
app-based platform, enabling quick 
reporting and immediate follow-up of 
any quality related issues.
Consistently enhancing the service 
and experience offered to customers 
is a core pillar of our strategy. In recent 
years, we have encouraged customers 
to adopt digital channels to interact 
with us, enhancing the features and 
user experience of the MySLT App. We 
also continued to invest in developing 
the product knowledge and customer-
service skills of our front-line staff while 
the contact centre employees have 
access to a dedicated training unit 
ensuring that they remain updated on 
the dynamic and evolving requirements 
of customers. 
Pandemic-led disruptions have 
changed the world as we know it, 
dramatically altering the way we 
work, learn, entertain and connect 
with others. As Sri Lanka’s national 
ICT and telecommunications service 
provider, we remain steadfast 
in our commitment to facilitate 
this transition by empowering 
individuals, businesses and the 
government through connectivity and 
digitalisation.

OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
The global telecommunications 
industry is the bedrock on which 
modern socioeconomic activity 
is built and it is hard to imagine a 
sphere of activity untouched by 
telecommunications. The pandemic 
made its relevance universal as it 
underpinned the way we interacted 
with the rest of the world. Working 
from home, online learning and 
entertainment were seamlessly 
integrated while applications to 
engage and empower customers 
proliferated accelerating digitalisation 
of nearly every aspect of life. 
Technology companies experienced 
unprecedented demand for their 
services and this amplified the 
demand for broadband services. The 
trend continued in 2021 as waves 
and variants of COVID-19 continued 
to disrupt economic activity. Working 
from home, online learning and 
entertainment were seamlessly 
integrated as the world embraced 
the possibilities of the 5th industrial 
revolution. Business experienced 
cost efficiencies as digital platforms 
provided the scalability and cost 
rationalisation that were a key area 
of focus. Consumer dependency on 
e-commerce surged as did financial 
transactions. 
For Telcos, the investments continue 
to be an area of key concern as 
the rapid evolution in technology 
necessitates replacement of old 
technologies prior to economic 
utilisation of their useful life. However, 
it has also meant that markets 
were getting saturated and intense 
competition was eroding margins. 
The services offered by Telcos were 
becoming more commoditized and 
future forward Telcos needed to 
transform into technology companies, 
expanding their portfolio of value 
added services to compete effectively 
with established technology 
companies. Telcos are well poised 
for the transformation as the 
analytics available provide a distinct 
competitive advantage. Unlocking 
this value will be key to increasing 
the share of wallet of the customer 
and extending their life cycle by 
adding relevant products to manage 
customer value.
COUNTRY PROFILE
Sri Lanka’s economy is estimated to 
have grown by 4%1after weathering 
a lockdown in the 3rd quarter due to 
the Delta variant. The country made 
significant progress in vaccinating its 
population with 96% of its population 
vaccinated with at least one dose, 
82% with the 2nd dose and 54% 
with the booster by 26th March 
2022.2 Interest rates which were low 
in the first half of the year moved 
upwards in the latter half as monetary 
policy was tightened in response to 
economic developments. Inflation 
increased during the year to 12.1% 
which was driven by a number of 
factors including increased supply 
chain costs and commodity prices. 
Additionally, the sharp decrease in 
inflows of foreign exchange for a 
prolonged period and government 
debt repayments resulted in a 
foreign exchange liquidity crisis 
and a devaluation of the Sri Lankan 
rupee leading to wide ranging import 
restrictions and an energy crisis by 
early 2022.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
SECTOR IN SRI LANKA
The Telecommunications sector in the 
country is one of the most dynamic 
sectors and its growth was accelerated 
with the onset of the COVID-19 
pandemic in 2020. Social distancing 
became a necessity since then to 
minimise risk, and wide ranging 
business disruptions made working 
from home and learning from home 
a necessity, increasing the demand 
for reliable telecommunication 
services to stay connected to family, 
workplaces, learning institutions, 
other economic activity and social 
interactions. An essential service 
that supports Sri Lanka’s connectivity 
to global opportunities, the 
telecommunications sector grew 
by 10.9% in 2020 and accounted 
for 0.66% of GDP in the same year.

has been supported by accelerated 
digitalisation of business applications 
to facilitate customer engagement 
and enable employees to work 
remotely during the past two years. 
This trend is expected to continue as 
we move into the industrial revolution 
that is being shaped by the rapid 
adoption of artificial intelligence 
supported by access to big data 
and improved hardware processing 
capabilities.
Telecommunications is pivotal 
to the country’s digital future 
as it provides the necessary 
infrastructure to drive growth. Sri 
Lanka’s telecommunications sector is 
regulated by the Telecommunications 
Regulatory Commission (TRC). 
Additionally, the Information and 
Communications Technology 
Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) is a 
key government agency shaping 
the development of the national 
telecommunications and technology 
landscape with a mandate to making 
Sri Lanka a digitally inclusive country 
with a mission of transforming Sri 
Lanka as a creative knowledge-based 
society.
There are 28 licenses issued by 
the TRC as above and the Sri 
Lanka Telecom Group holds 4 of 
these licenses as set out in the 
table alongside. Growth of the 
country’s telecommunication sector 
is graphically depicted overleaf. 
The charts set out reflect the 
coverage and increasing demand for 
telecommunication services in the 
country.

DETERMINING MATERIAL ISSUES
72 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management is 
fundamental to the Group’s 
ability to create sustainable 
value for stakeholders 
in the short, medium 
and long term and the 
Group has set in place a 
robust risk management 
structure and processes for 
management of enterprise 
risks. These processes also 
facilitate identification of 
opportunities for growth 
which is an integral part 
of the risk management 
process.
RISK GOVERNANCE
The Board bears ultimate 
responsibility for managing risk and 
allocating resources to mitigation 
of the same. The SLT Group has in 
place a well-established system of 
risk management which enables the 
Group to identify, measure, monitor 
and manage risks effectively. The 
year under review saw significant 
threats emerge which have been 
managed with increased alert levels 
throughout the Group, facilitating 
early identification and mitigation of 
potential risks.

AN UNCERTAIN RISK 
LANDSCAPE
The prolonged duration of the 
pandemic posed significant threats 
exposing and amplifying the 
economic vulnerability of people, 
businesses and countries. Business 
disruption continued in 2021 with 
new variants and waves, heightening 
concerns for health and safety and 
business continuity. Vaccinations 
were rolled out albeit unevenly 
across countries and by early 2022, 
a number of countries were well into 
the booster dose. Predictions that the 
pandemic was nearing endemicity 
saw a return to physical work as 
employers were eager for employees 
to return to work as supply chain 
and logistics issues continued to 
hinder economic activity and growth. 
Inflation rose as commodity prices 
increased in the first half of 2021 and 
supply demand stresses continued. 
Quantitative easing measures 
adopted by many governments with 
the onset of the pandemic gave 
way to tightening monetary policy 
resulting in upward movement of 
interest rates in the latter half of 
2021. Migration to digital platforms 
by individuals and entities continued 
during the year and businesses 
accelerated their digitalisation plans, 
enhancing capacity utilisation of 
digital infrastructure around the 
world. Cybersecurity threats increased 
exponentially with hackers becoming 
more sophisticated giving rise to 
increased investments cybersecurity. 
By the 4th quarter of 2021 there 
was a convergence of risk factors in 
Sri Lanka, increasing its economic 
vulnerability and resulting in further 
downgrades to its sovereign rating. 
Continuing woes in the Tourism 
sector and lower inward remittance 
coupled with large government debt 
repayments resulted in a foreign 
exchange liquidity crisis which has 
also led to an energy crisis and a 
sharp devaluation of the Sri Lankan 
rupee by end March 2022. The 
seeming convergence of risk factors 
has exacerbated the uncertainties 
for the year ahead with significant 
uncertainties in the socioeconomic 
landscape.

RISK SUMMARY
Risks Mitigation & Opportunities Assessment
FINANCIAL RISKS
Financial resilience is key to growth and sustainability of the business and sustained earnings
 Increasing interest rates
 Potential deterioration in affordability of 
services and credit quality due to inflationary 
pressures and reduced disposable income
 Elevated levels of exchange rate risk with 
sharp devaluation of the Sri Lankan rupee in 
March 2022 making investments expensive
 Foreign exchange liquidity crisis with wide 
ranging import restrictions
 Exchange rate risk makes investments in 
infrastructure more expansive
 Commodity price risk and inflation is 
expected to increase operational costs
 Risk rating affirmed at AA- (lka) with a stable 
outlook by Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd., supports 
Group’s ability to source capital
 Prudent debt equity ratio of 66.1% provides 
sufficient headroom for increasing debt in 
case of need
 Prudent debt management and strong 
cashflow generation mitigates potential 
impact of rising interest rates
 Strong credit control supports liquidity
 Enhancing digital payment channels for retail 
customers
 Introducing several Financing options to 
reduce forex exposure
 Potential opportunities for growth in payment 
channel offerings to customers
 Headroom to increase tariffs as it is amongst 
the lowest in the world although this needs to 
be balanced with inflationary pressures 
 SLT Group dollar deposits provide a hedge 
against exchange rate fluctuations
High
Despite increasing 
threat levels, the 
Group is financially 
resilient as evinced by 
its strong credit rating 
affirmed in January 
2022. However, the 
impact on profitability 
can be high due to 
the escalation in 
operational costs. 
Therefore, the risk is 
assessed as High.
PEOPLE RISKS
Risks related to workforce, consumers, and community
 Spread of pandemic within workforce and 
community
 Health and safety of employees and 
consumers
 Retaining skilled talent pools during 
economic crisis
 Upskilling employees to adapt to changes in 
technology and digital transformation
 Supporting employees migrate to new norms 
of working
 Implemented stringent health and safety 
protocols to mitigate pandemic risks 
including remote working, minimising 
physical gatherings, provision of PPE, holistic 
care package for employees
 Increasing investment in training and 
development aligning with digital 
transformation 
 Intrapreneurship opportunities for employees 
through The Embryo initiative
Mitigating actions 
implemented for 
People risks have 
been effective, 
supporting growth 
in employee and 
customer satisfaction. 
Despite this, the risk 
is assessed as High 
due to the strategic 
importance of the risk 
category.
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
 Annual Report 2021 | 75
Risks Mitigation & Opportunities Assessment
TECHNOLOGY RISK
The rapid evolution of technology in the telecommunications and allied fields, the surge in demand with the onset of the 
pandemic and opportunities for institutional transformation makes this category of risk critical to sustained earning growth. 
 Consumer demand for increasingly high 
bandwidth and speeds for evolving lifestyles
 Surge in subscriber base and digital 
transaction volumes which may or may not be 
sustained in a post pandemic era
 Affordability of new technologies in emerging 
and developing markets
 Speed of technology evolution in increasing, 
making current technologies obsolete
 Dedicated network planning function to 
assess short-, medium-, and long-term needs 
of the SLT Group
 Accelerated investments to meet the surge in 
demand
 Expansion and roll out of fibre and 5G 
networks
 Investment in the 6th SEA-ME-WE cable, 
upgrading of the 4th and retirement of the 
3rd cables.
 Collaboration with ICTA, TRCSL and other 
influential technology associations to assess 
future requirements and planning investments
As adoption of 
cutting-edge 
technology is critical 
to the Group’s 
strategic goals, the 
risks are assessed as 
High.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
As telecommunications is an essential service, maintaining continuous service in a safe and secure manner presents 
significant challenges which are classified as operational risks.
 Business continuity amidst the pandemic 
and related lockdowns presented several 
challenges
 Servicing customer requests and visiting 
homes presented challenges for field staff
 Cyberthreats escalated during the year 
 Ensuring sufficient energy for network 
operations during energy crisis
 Compliance with evolving regulatory 
requirements
 Detailed business continuity plans prepared 
to manage the risks during pandemic
 Strict health and safety protocols 
implemented to minimise threat of contagion
 Ramped up investments in cyber security 
to identify and monitor potential threats to 
institution and customers
 Increased rigour of oversight and review by 
internal audit
 Processes are in place to facilitate regulatory 
compliance which is also a matter of internal 
audit review
Assessed as Medium 
due to efficacy of 
mitigation activities
76 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
Risks Mitigation & Opportunities Assessment
STRATEGIC RISKS
These risks have a significant impact in determining the effectiveness of strategy and achievement of goals.
 Consumer behaviour patterns underwent a 
significant change during the pandemic and 
remain in a state of flux
 The business model of the Group is 
evolving and a planned transformation 
from a telecommunications company to a 
technology company is taking shape and 
form
 As resources are finite, it is critical to prioritise 
strategies and allocate sufficient resources to 
achieve successful outcomes
 As the National Telecommunications 
service provider, our reputation is critical to 
maintaining reliable and credible relationships 
with our stakeholders
 Data analytics undertaken to monitor 
consumer behaviour
 Focus on Research and Development through 
the Embryo project
 Regular stakeholder surveys
 Prudent management of resources 
 Well established procurement and tender 
procedures with oversight by the Board
 Brand surveys
 Ratings
 Clear communication of transformational 
goals and management of the process
Threat is assessed 
as Medium due 
to effectiveness of 
mitigating activities
ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS
Environmental risks are increasingly becoming apparent with depletion of non-renewable sources and resultant demand 
supply gaps
 Energy management is key to managing 
emissions and impact on climate change
 Rising costs of energy 
 Rising costs of non-renewable resources due 
to supply limitations

INCOME STATEMENT
Revenue 
Group revenue increased by 12.3% 
to Rs.102.3 Bn in 2021 as online 
activity surged with continuing 
lockdowns and acceleration of 
digital infrastructure development 
by businesses. Consumer migration 
to digital platforms for transactions, 
learning and entertainment continued 
to gather momentum in 2021 as 
well. Intermittent lockdowns also 
necessitated working and learning 
online which supported increased 
usage of broadband. PEO TV 
also recorded healthy growth 
underpinned by surge in usage and 
new connections. Usage increased 
across all customer segments ranging 
from individuals to corporate and 
government entities. Demand for 
fixed voice services was stable in 2021 
supported by increased connections 
in contrast to the declining trend 
observed in 2020.
Increased coverage through the 
Group’s accelerated fibre expansion 
programme and the expansion of 
the 4G LTE network were major 
contributory factors for new 
connections. It is noteworthy that 
the revenue increase was achieved 
despite offering attractive pricing on 
learning and working tariff packages 
taking into consideration the need to 
ensure affordability and also that there 
were no tariff increases during the 
reporting year.
Revenue from Carrier Domestic 
business grew significantly during 
the year while the revenue from data 
products provided to Corporate and 
Government business segments too 
grew notably year-on-year. 
Revenue from Fixed Telephony 
increased by 16% to Rs.59.8 Bn in 
2021 accounting for 53.4% of Group 
Revenue. Mobile revenue increased 
by 8.7% to Rs.47.1 Bn accounting  
for 44.5% of Group Revenue.
EBITDA
Group EBITDA increased by 16.1% 
to Rs. 41.2 Bn reinforced by revenue 
growth and improved operational 
efficiencies. The brand unification 
played a key role in driving synergies 
which enabled us to curtail marketing 
cost increase to 9.3%. Additionally, 
programmes such as waste to cash 
also drove savings as we recycled 
and repurposed used materials, 
integrating sustainable practices into 
our processes. These resulted in an 
improved EBITDA margin of 40.2% 
in 2021 compared to 38.9% in 2020 
which was commendable as it was 
achieved without upward revisions in 
tariff structures.
Fixed operations of the Group 
recorded an EBITDA of Rs. 21.4 Bn, 
up by 16.4%. The EBITDA margin 
grew from 35.7% in the year before to 
35.9%. EBITDA of Mobile operations 
grew to Rs. 19.5 Bn, reflecting a 
17.7% growth, pushing the EBITDA 
margin up to 41.3% from 38.2% in the 
year 2020.

MANAGING COSTS
Cost rationalisation was a key area 
in 2021 as the Group needed to 
increase spending in Sales and 
Marketing to grow market share while 
depreciation was exerting pressure 
on costs as we continued to upgrade 
and expand our network. During the 
year, Administrative costs increased 
by 10.7% primarily stemming from the 
increased Depreciation & Amortisation 
costs by 14.7%  and increased 
International Settlement cost by Rs. 
1.4 Bn resulting from the increase of 
Transit revenue during the year. The 
overall cost increase of 11.3%, which 
was sufficiently below the revenue 
growth rate of 12.3%, together lifted 
the Operating Profit up by 19% and 
improved the Operating Profit margin 
to 13.5%.
PROFIT BEFORE & AFTER TAX
Profit before tax (PBT) increased by 
32% to Rs.12.8 Bn supported by 
increased revenue, improved cost 
management, increase in other income 
and reduced foreign exchange losses. 
Taxation also decreased during the 
year by 64.1% due to reduced tax rates 
which also provided a strong boost to 
profitability. Accordingly, profit after tax 
increased by 54.3% to Rs.12.2 Bn. 
Sri Lanka Telecom 
strengthened its financial 
position through strategic 
investments to enhance 
revenue generation 
capability and prudent 
capital management to 
strengthen its financial 
resilience. The infographic 
below reflects the changes 
from 2020 to 2021.
FINANCIAL CAPITAL
Profit after tax of Mobile operations 
recorded its highest profits in its

managed to maintain the Trade

OUR MANAGEMENT 
APPROACH
Our Human Resource (HR) policies 
and procedures are compliant with the 
relevant Sri Lankan labour laws and 
regulatory standards and aligned to 
industry best practices. Robust policy 
frameworks are in place to ensure that 
an equitable and thriving environment 
is created for all our employees. We 
continuously review the HR reporting 
and governance structure that is in 
place and make necessary changes to 
ensure it is relevant and up to date.
The changes made during the year are 
mentioned below. 
 Rearrangement of the regional 
group structure to empower 
regional management to initiate 
internal staff deployments within 
regions. This will enhance the 
employee work-life balance, 
facilitate ease of working and 
enable the delivery of a strong 
customer service.
 Cadre Review and new 
organizational design in line 
with span of control and line of 
authority benchmarked across SLT 
PLC.
MOVEMENTS IN OUR TEAM
We have in place a structured 
talent sourcing and management 
strategy which set out the process 
for attracting, developing and 
retaining our employees. It is a holistic 
approach, which creates the right 
values and environment for staff to 
feel empowered and is a key factor for 
our success. 
Our recruitment procedure is robust, 
involving an interview and several 
assessment processes to ensure 
the right individuals are directly 
absorbed into the organization on a 
permanent basis. As a leading digital 
services provider in Sri Lanka, in 
the next few years we are planning 
to incorporate virtual reality into 
the recruitment process to test 
certain skills of the candidates, 
which will give them an outstanding 
experience while also creating brand 
recognition for the organization. 
Despite the many challenges created 
by the pandemic, there was no 
downsizing of staff during the year. 
In 2021, we recruited a total of 185 
employees at SLT, including the 
children of our employees as well as 
the immediate family members of 
demised employees. Our retention 
rate is over 98.75%, which is a strong 
testament to the strength of our 
value proposition to employees. 285 
employees retired during the year 
while only 67 employees resigned.  At 
Mobitel, we recruited a total of 174 
employees during the year and we 
have a retention rate of 94.15%.

DIGITALIZATION OF HR 
OPERATIONS
In order to implement a digital 
workplace strategy, various HR 
Processes including recruitment, talent 
development and promotion were 
automated during the year, leading 
to reduction in the time spent on 
repetitive tasks as well as creating 
a green atmosphere within the HR 
Group. The planned implementation 
of Document Management System 
(DMS) via the ERP system will lead 
to a reduction of paper usage by 
70%-80% within the HR Group. 
Digital transformation is affecting 
the human resource management 
function at a rapid speed, allowing 
HR to become more data driven by 
presenting evidence-based insights to 
make accurate decisions. The biggest 
challenge for the HR Group in this 
data driven culture will be finding the 
right balance between technology 
and the human role.
The latest advancements in machine 
learning and artificial intelligence 
are rapidly developing in the global 
scenario. We hope to integrate these 
developments into our HR processes 
in the next few years for the benefit of 
the organization as a whole.
EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND 
SAFETY
GRI: A1.1 / A1.2 / A1.3 / A1.4 / A1.5 / A1.6
As a responsible employer, ensuring 
the health and wellbeing of our 
people became a priority during the 
year. We fully adhere to the health 
and other statutory requirements and 
have implemented organization wide 
HR policies through the establishment 
of a COVID-19 management steering 
committee.  
Having continued operations during 
the pandemic, we understood the 
impact of the pandemic on work, the 
workforce and workplace. HR became 
the centerpiece of guiding and 
managing the other functions in the 
adoption of organization wide safety

REMUNERATION, 
RECOGNITION AND REWARDS
As part of our people experience, we 
provide an attractive and competitive 
remuneration for all our employees. In 
addition to the remuneration, we offer 
a range of other benefits and rewards 
including loans at concessionary 
rates, medical allowances and death 
donations. These are designed to 
retain employees and motivate them 
to perform better in order to help 
the organization achieve its overall 
strategic goals. During the year, 
longstanding salary anomalies were 
addressed through an equitable 
solution. The table above shows the 
benefits provided to employees and 
their families who were affected by 
COVID 19.
Performance Management 
We have a performance-based 
culture where 100% of our employees 
undergo performance appraisals 
evaluated on predetermined key 
performance indicators during the 
year. Employees are recognized and 
rewarded through performance-based 
bonuses linked to the Performance 
Management System. During the year, 
individual performance management 
with peer evaluation system was also 
introduced to the final evaluation 
process. We have also aligned the 
rewarding mechanism with the 
organizational innovation framework. 
Career Progression
We nurture a strong learning 
environment through succession 
planning and leadership development 
initiatives which helps our employees 
reach their full potential. Having 
understood the role of leaders in 
driving the growth of the people, 
last year, we completed a plan to 
ensure a strong leadership pipeline 
is maintained for the top level. Based 
on this plan, succession planning was 
implemented this year as well.
Opportunities for promotions are 
available to employees if they meet 
the defined criteria in the SLT Staff 
Recruitment and Promotion Scheme 
(SRPS) based on their professional 
qualifications, performance, and 
experience. Candidates are selected 
for promotions through written 
examinations and/or interviews. 
During the year initiatives were taken 
to redesign the SRPS based on current 
industry standards. This will strengthen 
employee skills and create a skill-
based path for career advancement.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
Enhancing the knowledge and 
capabilities of our workforce is a 
key value proposition offered by the 
Group. We assess the knowledge gap 
of employees and fulfill the training 
requirements accordingly. Training 
and development opportunities are 
offered through formal and on the 
job training with regular feedback 
provided via the appraisal system. 
During the year, with the digitalization 
of operations and increased remote 
working arrangements, there was a 
need to provide training to improve 
IT capabilities, network connectivity 
and cyber security knowledge of the 
employees as well.
SLT Talent Development Division 
The SLT Talent Development Division 
which constitutes our training delivery 
arm has three fully fledged Talent 
Development Centers (TDC) which 
are ISO 9001:2015 certified. Although 
these centres were initiated for the 
development of the human capital 
of the company, we have expanded 
our capacity through affiliations with 
reputed bodies, to generate revenue 
for SLT. TDC has proven its strength 
in the higher education sector of 
the country by opening doors to the 
public to pursue technician certificates 
and Higher National Diplomas. In 
collaboration with the University 
of Hertfordshire – UK, TDC offers 
a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) 
Degree program as well. Even with 
the numerous challenges created by 
the COVID-19 pandemic, SLTDC has 
been able to generate Rs. 88 Mn as 
revenue for SLT in 2021.

Relationships with trade unions
87.3% of the organization’s employees are represented through 24 trade 
unions and covered by collective bargaining process. We maintained cordial 
relationships with the trade unions and there were no instances of disruption to 
work on industrial disputes during the period under review. Having understood 
the importance of this stakeholder group, we have adopted an open-door policy 
and an inclusive approach with them and have built a strong mutually beneficial 
relationship over the years, which has helped us to improve working conditions, 
enable better decision making through collective bargaining as well as promoting 
equality and harmony within the Group. There is a dedicated section in the HR 
Group to attend to the trade union concerns as quickly as possible.
We support the right to exercise freedom of association and collective bargaining by:
Diverse workplace and Gender Parity
We pride ourselves in being an equal 
opportunity employer nurturing a 
diverse and inclusive culture within 
the organization. We have employees 
with varying skills, perspectives and 
social and religious backgrounds 
who blend together to provide an 
excellent level of service. Our policies 
and procedures promote equality 
of opportunity regardless of gender, 
age, race or religion and we do not 
discriminate employees based on any 
grounds. There were no incidents of 
discrimination reported during the year.
Gender diversity is a key area of focus 
through all levels of the Company, 
and we are committed to creating 
an enabling environment for women 
working within the company. We 
have 26% females within our team 
despite being in the tech industry 
where traditionally women are under 
represented. During the year, all 
pregnant women were allowed to 
work from home to ensure their safety. 
We provide maternity leave as per the 
stipulated regulations.
 Considering the fact that 
many global corporations 
have announced plans to 
embrace some form of 
remote working beyond 
the pandemic, we are 
also looking to make 
these modes of work a 
permanent fixture in the 
Company’s range of work 
options.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF  
SRI LANKA TELECOM PLC
Report on the audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Sri Lanka

which comprise the Statement of Financial Position as at 
31 December 2021, and the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement 
of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes to the 
Financial Statements, including a summary of significant 
accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying Financial Statements of 
the Company and the Group give a true and fair view of the 
financial position of the Company and the Group as at  
31 December 2021, and of their financial performance and 
cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Sri 
Lanka Accounting Standards.
Basis for opinion  
We conducted our audit in accordance with Sri Lanka 
Auditing Standards (SLAuSs). Our responsibilities under 
those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements 
section of our report. We are independent of the Group in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by CA Sri Lanka 
(Code of Ethics) and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit matters  
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
Financial Statements of the current period. These matters 
were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
For each matter below, our description of how our audit 
addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial 
Statements section of our report, including in relation 
to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the 
performance of procedures designed to respond to our 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
Financial Statements. The results of our audit procedures, 
including the procedures performed to address the matters 
below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the 
accompanying Financial Statements.

120 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter
Revenue recognition of fixed telephony and mobile 
communication services
The Group recognized revenue of LKR 100,269 Mn from the 
provision of fixed telephony & mobile communication services 
for the year ended 31 December 2021 in accordance with its 
accounting policy set out in Note 3 (k) to the financial statements
Recognition of revenue from the provision of fixed telephony & 
mobile communication services was a key focus of our audit due 
to:
—  Provision of telecommunication services to customers involve 
frequent changes in rate structures and arrangements with 
multiple features. It comprises a large volume of transactions 
which arise from sales of different combinations of hardware 
and services that are captured, processed and recorded by 
the Group using multiple IT systems.
—  Significant judgement exercised by management when 
determining: 
a. Whether to recognize revenue at a point in time or over 
a period for revenue arrangements  
b.  Duration of customer contracts  
c. Transaction price and allocating it to bundled products 
and services
Our audit procedures included the following amongst others;
> We involved our internal specialized resources to assist us with;
>  Evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of IT 
General Controls and IT Application Controls of IT systems 
having significant impact over revenue recognition.
> Evaluating the adequacy of controls implemented for security 
monitoring aspects over selected IT systems related to revenue 
recognition.
> We evaluated the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of IT dependent manual controls and manual controls 
including performing re-computations and testing end-to-end 
reconciliations, as relevant.
> We assessed the reasonableness of significant judgements 
made by management when determining the timing of revenue 
recognition, duration of customer contracts and when allocating 
transaction price to bundled products and services of major 
revenue streams, based on the respective terms and conditions of 
customer contracts.
> We also assessed the adequacy of related disclosures reflected in 
Note 3 (k) and Note 6 (a) of the Financial Statements.
Estimated Useful Lives and Capital Work-in-Progress of Network 
Assets
As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s network assets accounted 
for 43% of the consolidated total assets and Group’s capital work-
in-progress related to such network assets accounted for 9% of 
the consolidated total assets. 
Depreciation on network assets amounted to LKR 16,685 Mn 
for the year ended 31 December 2021. The Group’s policy is to 
calculate the depreciation of an asset over its estimated useful life 
on a straight-line basis.
Estimating the useful lives of network assets requires judgment by 
the management and is a key focus for our audit. It involves the 
Group’s collective assessment of the industry practice, internal 
technical evaluation and experience with the similar assets in 
concluding the useful lives of network assets.
Capital work in progress of network assets was a key focus for our 
audit due to the:
—  Degree of judgement involved, and assumptions used when 
assessing impairment of amounts of capital work – in – 
progress relevant to projects of an extended duration
and
—  Importance of timeliness in transferring amounts from capital 
work – in – progress of network assets to the relevant class of 
property, plant and equipment, when such items have been 
commissioned for use.
The Group’s disclosures on property and equipment are included 
in Notes 3 (d) and 14 to the consolidated Financial Statements 
and the disclosures on capital work-in-progress are included in 
Notes 3 (d) (iv) and 14 to the consolidated Financial Statements.
Our audit procedures included the following amongst others;
> We obtained an understanding of the Group’s process in estimating 
the useful lives of network assets. 
> We inquired with the Group’s network engineers on their evaluation 
of the relevance of current technology and its utilization for future 
periods. 
> We tested management assessment of the estimated useful lives 
of network assets against industry data and practice and other 
relevant external data. 
> We evaluated whether management has identified possible 
indicators of impairment for any project related to network 
assets which have not been commissioned for a prolonged 
period including evaluating the reasonableness of management 
judgements applied and assumptions used based on our 
knowledge of the business and industry.
> By discussion with the respective project managers and inspection 
of relevant documentation, we 
>  checked the current status of completion of those projects in 
relation to budgeted project duration 
and
>  whether amounts related to network assets commissioned for 
use have been appropriately transferred out of capital work–in-
progress and recognized under the relevant class of property, 
plant & equipment, on a timely basis
> We also assessed the adequacy of related disclosures made in the 
Financial Statements.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
 Annual Report 2021 | 121
Other Information included in the 2021 Annual Report
Other information consists of the information included in the 
Annual Report, other than the Financial Statements and our 
auditor’s report thereon. Management is responsible for the 
other information.
Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover 
the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our 
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing 
so, consider whether the other information is materially 
inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge 
obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially 
misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact. We have 
nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the management and those charged with 
governance
Management is responsible for the preparation of Financial 
Statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with 
Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, and for such internal control 
as management determines is necessary to enable the 
preparation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the Financial Statements, management is 
responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting unless management either intends to liquidate 
the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for 
overseeing the Company’s and the Group’s financial 
reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial 
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not 
a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with 
SLAuSs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial 
Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, we exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:
> Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of 
the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those 
risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk 
of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. 
> Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
internal controls of the Company and the Group.
> Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and 
related disclosures made by management.
> Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of 
the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the 
audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty 
exists related to events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the Financial 
Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
> Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, 
and whether the Financial Statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation.
> Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the 
consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for 
the direction, supervision and performance of the group 
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a 
statement that we have complied with ethical requirements in 
accordance with the Code of Ethics regarding independence, 
and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter should not be communicated in our report because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such 
communication.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
As required by section 163 (2) of the Companies Act No. 
07 of 2007, we have obtained all the information and 
explanations that were required for the audit and as far as 
appears from our examination, proper accounting records 
have been kept by the Company.

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

and have been applied consistently by the Group 
entities,except amendments to existing accounting standards 
which are efffective from 1 January 2021 as described in 
Note 3 (w)
(a) Basis of consolidation
(i) Business combinations
The Group accounts for business combinations using the 
acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group. 
The consideration transferred in acquisition is generally 
measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets 
acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for 
impairment. Any gain or bargain purchase is recognised in 
profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed 
as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity 
securities.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts 
related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such 
amounts are generally recognised in Statement of Profit or 
Loss.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at 
the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent 
consideration that meets the definition of a financial 
instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured 
and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount 
recognized for non-controlling interests and any previous 
interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed). If the fair value of the net assets acquired 
is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the 
Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of 
the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and 
reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be 
recognized at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still 
results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired 
over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the 
recognized in Statement of Profit or Loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less 
any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose 
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business 
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to 
benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other 
assets or liabilities of the acquire are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit 
(CGU) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation 
is included in the carrying amount of the operation when 
determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed 
in these circumstances is measured based on the relative 
values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-
generating unit retained.
(ii) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. 
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the 
Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Group loses control over the subsidiary.
As per the reporting date the group has changed the 
accounting treatment of its investments in SLT Campus 
(Private) Limited from a subsidiary to non current assets held 
for sale as per the ‘SLFRS 5 - Non current assets held for sale 
and discontionued operations’ as disclosed in note 16.1 and 
22.
(ii- a)  Critical judgements in applying the entity’s 
accounting policies
The directors have concluded that the Group controls all 
subsidiaries as it has majority control and voting rights over 
its subsidiaries as depicted in Note (ii-b).
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 131
(iii) Equity - accounted investees (Investment in associates 
and joint ventures)
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant 
influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in 
the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee 
but is not control or joint control over those policies.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the 
parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights 
to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, 
which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities 
require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining significant influence 
or joint control is similar to those necessary to determine 
control over subsidiaries. The Group’s investments in its 
associates and joint venture are accounted for using the 
equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate 
or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying 
amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in 
the Group’s share of net assets of the associate or joint venture 
since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate 
or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment and is not tested for impairment separately.
The Statement of Profit or Loss reflects the Group’s share of 
the results of operations of the associate or joint venture. Any 
change in Other Comprehensive Income of those investees 
is presented as part of the Group’s Other Comprehensive 
Income. In addition, when there has been a change 
recognised directly in the equity of the associate or joint 
venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when 
applicable, in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Unrealised 
gains and losses resulting from transactions between the 
Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to 
the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit or loss of 
an associate and a joint venture is shown on the face of 
the Statement of Profit or Loss outside operating profit 
and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling 
interests in the subsidiaries of the associate or joint venture.
The Financial Statements of the associate or joint venture are 
prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting 
policies in line with those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group 
determines whether it is necessary to recognise an 
impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint 
venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that the investment in 
the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such 
evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment 
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 
associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then 
recognises the loss as ‘Share of profit or loss of equity 
accounted investees’ in the Statement of Profit or Loss.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint 
control over the joint venture, the Group measures and 
recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any 
difference between the carrying amount of the associate or 
joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control 
and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds 
from disposal is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.
(iv)  Non conrtolling interest ( NCI)
NCI are measured at their proportionate share of acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.Changes in 
the group interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss 
of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
(v) Loss of control
When the group loses control over a subsidiary, it 
derecognises the asset and liabilities of the subsidiary and 
any related NCI (if applicable) and other components of 
equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss. Any interest in the former subsidiary is measured at fair 
value when control is lost.
(vi) Transaction eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealised 
income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, 
are eliminated.
(b) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the 
respective functional currencies of Group companies at the 
exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at 
the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that 
are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated 
into the functional currency at the exchange rate when the 
fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences 
are generally recognised in statement of profit or loss and 
other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are 
measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are 
not translated.
(c)  Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity.
(i)  Financial assets
(i-i)  Initial recognition and mearsurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through 
profit or loss.
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition 
depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow 
characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing 
them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not 
contain a significant financing component or for which the 
Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially 
measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case 
of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a 
significant financing component or for which the Group 
has applied the practical expedient are measured at the 
transaction price as disclosed in Note 3(k) - Revenue from 
contracts with customers.
In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured 
at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give 
rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and 
interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding. This 
assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed 
at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that 
are not SPPI are classified and measured at fair value through 
profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.
The Group’s business model for managing financial assets 
refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to 
generate cash flows. The business model determines 
whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash 
flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets 
are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition 
unless the Group changes its business model for managing 
financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets 
are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period 
following the change in the business model.Purchases or 
sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within 
a time frame established by regulation or convention in the 
market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade 
date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or 
sell the asset.
(i-ii)  Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets 
are classified in four categories;
> Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
> Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of 
cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)
> Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI 
with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon 
derecognition (equity instruments)
> Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments)
The Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both 
following conditions are met:
> The financial asset is held within a business model with 
the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect 
contractual cash flows, and
> The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 133
Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured 
using the effective interest rate (EIR) method and are subject 
to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or 
loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.
The Group’s financial assets at amortised cost include trade 
and other receivables, amounts due from related parties and 
cash and cash equivalents.
Financial assets at fair value through OCI (debt instruments)
The Group measures debt instruments at fair value through 
OCI if both of following conditions are met:
> The financial asset is held within a business model with 
the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash 
flows and selling, and
> The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on 
specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments 
of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
For debt instruments at fair value through OCI, interest 
income, foreign exchange revaluation and impairment 
losses or reversals are recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss and computed in the same manner as for financial 
assets measured at amortised cost. The remaining fair value 
changes are recognised in OCI. Upon derecognition, the 
cumulative fair value change recognised in OCI is recycled to 
profit or loss.
Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI (equity 
instruments)
Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify 
irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments 
designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the 
definition of equity under LKAS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is 
determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.
Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled 
to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in 
the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has 
been established, except when the Group benefits from such 
proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial 
asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity 
instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not 
subject to impairment assessment.
This category includes listed and non listed equity 
instruments that the Group elected to classify irrevocably.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include 
financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated 
upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, 
or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at 
fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if 
they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing 
in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded 
derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they 
are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial 
assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of 
principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value 
through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. 
Notwithstanding the criteria for debt instruments to be 
classified at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, as 
described above, debt instruments may be designated at fair 
value through profit or loss on initial recognition if doing so 
eliminates, or significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried 
in the statement of financial position at fair value with net 
changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or 
loss.
This category includes derivative instruments and listed 
equity investments which the Group had not irrevocably 
elected to classify at fair value through OCI. Dividends on 
listed equity investments are also recognised as other income 
in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment 
has been established.
A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, with a financial 
liability or non-financial host, is separated from the host 
and accounted for as a separate derivative if: the economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related to the host; a 
separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded 
derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and 
the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through 
profit or loss. Embedded derivatives are measured at fair 
value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. 
Reassessment only occurs if there is either a change in the 
terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash 
flows that would otherwise be required or a reclassification 
of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss 
category.
(i-iii) Fair value measurement
SLFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be 
received to sell and asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transactions between market participants at the 
measurement date.
A Fair value measurement requires an entity to determine all 
the following;
1.  The particular asset or liability that is the subject of the 
measurement.
2.  For a non-financial asset, the valuation premise that is 
appropriate for the measurement (consistently with its 
highest and best use).
3.  The principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset 
or liability.
134 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
4.  The valuation technique(s) appropriate for the 
measurement, considering the availability of data with 
which to develop inputs that represent the assumptions 
that market participants would use when pricing the asset 
or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy within 
which the inputs are categorised.
5.  Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-
specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, 
observable market transactions or market.
When transaction price provides the best evidence of 
fair value at initial recognition, the financial instrument is 
initially measured at the transaction price and any difference 
between this price and the value initially obtained from a 
valuation model is subsequently recognised in profit or loss 
on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but 
not later than when the valuation is supported wholly by 
observable market data or the transaction is closed out.
Determination of Fair values
The determination of fair value for financial assets and 
liabilities for which there is no observable market price 
requires the use of valuation techniques. For financial 
instruments that trade infrequently and have little price 
transparency, fair value is less objective and requires varying 
degrees of judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, 
uncertainty of market factors, pricing assumption and other 
risks affecting the specific instrument.
Level 1 -  Fair value measurements using quoted prices 
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities;
Level 2 -  Fair value measurements using inputs other than 
quoted prices included within Level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e.,as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from 
prices);and
Level 3 -  Fair value measurements using inputs for the 
asset or liability that are not based on observable 
market data (i.e., unobservable inputs).
(i-iv)  Amortised cost
The amortised cost of a financial asset or liability is the 
amount at which the financial asset or liability is measured 
at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus 
or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective 
interest method of any difference between the initial amount 
recognised and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for 
impairment.
(i-v)  Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
Financial assets not classified at fair value through profit 
or loss, are assessed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
Objective evidence that financial assets are impaired 
includes;
> default or delinquency by a debtor;
> restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms 
that the Group would not consider otherwise;
> indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy;
> adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or 
issuers;
> the disappearance of an active market for a security; or
> Observable data indicating that there is a measurable 
decrease in the expected cash flows from a group of 
financial assets.
In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a 
significant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost 
is objective evidence of impairment.
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies 
a simplified approach in calculating Expected Credit Losses 
(ECLs). Therefore, the Group does not track changes in 
credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based 
on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.The Group has 
established a provision metrix that is based on its historical 
credit loss experiance,adjusted for forward looking factors 
specific to the debtors and the economic environment.
The Group considers a financial asset in default when 
contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in 
certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial 
asset to be in default when internal or external information 
indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the oustanding 
contractual amounts in full before taking into account any 
credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset 
is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovering the contractual cash flows.
Investments in fixed deposits,Treasuray Bills and Bonds are 
considered as low risk of default.
Non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its non-financial assets (other than investment 
property, inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
For impairment testing, assets are grouped together into 
the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows 
from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows of other assets or CGUs.
Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to 
CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from 
the synergies of the combination.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 135
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of 
its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use 
is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an 
asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss . They are 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 
For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been 
recognised.
(i-vi)  Hedge
For designated and qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective 
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is 
initially recognised directly in equity in the “cash flow hedge 
reserve”. The ineffective portion of the gains or losses on the 
hedge instrument is recognised immediately in the profit and 
loss.
When the hedge cash flow affect the Income Statement, 
the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in 
the corresponding income or expense line of the Income 
Statement. When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, 
terminated, exercised or when a hedge no longer meet the 
criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gains/losses 
existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains 
in other comprehensive income and is recognised in the 
income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur the cumulative gains/loss was reported in 
other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to 
the Income Statement.
(ii)  Financial liabilities
(ii-i)  Initial recognition and measurement
Financila Liabilities are classified,at initial recognition,as 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, 
loanes and borrowings,payables, or as appropriate.All 
financialliabilities are recognised initially at fair value and , 
in the case of loans, borrowings and payables,net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and 
other payables loans and borrowing including bank 
overdrafts,lease liabilities,contract liablities and deferred 
income.
(ii-ii) Subsequent measurement
Financial liabilities at amortised cost (Loans and borrowings)
This is the category most relevant to the Group. After 
initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
EIR method, after considering any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the 
EIR. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when 
the liabilities are derecognised. EIR amortisation is included 
as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.
(ii)-(iii)  Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation 
under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another 
from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the 
terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such 
an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. 
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is 
recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
(iii) Offseting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net 
amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 
position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset 
the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle 
on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities 
simultaneously.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets 
includes the cost of materials and direct labour and any other 
costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working 
condition for their intended use. Purchased software that 
is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is 
capitalised as part of that asset.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment 
have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and 
equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item 
if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied 
within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be 
measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of 
property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or 
loss.
(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, 
which is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted 
for cost, less its residual value. Depreciation is recognised 
136 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant 
and equipment. In the year of acquisition depreciation is 
computed on proportionate basis from the month the asset 
is put into use and no depreciation will be charged to the 
month in which the particular asset was disposed. Leased 
assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and 
their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group 
will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Land is 
not depreciated.
Depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate
The estimated useful lives for the assets are as follows:
Freehold buildings 5 - 40 years
Submarine cables 10 - 25 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
CDMA handsets 3 years
PABX system 1-6 years
IT systems 5 - 10 years
Other fixed assets 2 - 12.5 years
Network equipment
Ducts ,cables and other outside plant 5 - 20 years
Telephone exchanges and transmission 
equipment
5 -12.5 years
Towers 40 years
(iv) Capital work-in-progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost net of accumulated 
impairment losses, if any. These are expenses of a capital 
nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, 
network equipment, system development and other fixed 
assets, awaiting capitalisation.
Major spare parts and project related inventory qualify as 
Property, plant and equipment when the entity expects to 
use them during more than one year period and are used 
in connection with specific items of Property, plant and 
equipment.
(v) Derecognition
The carrying amount of an item of property, plant & 
equipment is derecognised on disposal.Gains and losses 
on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are 
determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with 
the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and 
are recognised net within “other income” in the statement of 
Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income.
When replacement costs are recognised in the carrying 
amount of an item of property, Plant and Equipment, 
the remaining carrying amount of the replaced part is 
derecognised. Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each 
such capitalisation, the remaining carrying amount of the 
previous cost of inspections is derecognised.
(vi)  Borrowing cost
Borrowing cost directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 
a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use 
or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective 
assets. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period 
they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other 
costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing 
of funds.
(e) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is 
included in intangible assets. For measurement of goodwill 
at initial recognition, see note 3 (a) (i)
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses.
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, 
which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses.
(iii) Licenses
Separately acquired licences are shown at historical cost. 
Expenditures on license fees that is deemed to benefit or 
relate to more than one financial year is classified as license 
fee and is being amortised over the License period on a 
straight line basis.
(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases 
the future economic benefits embodied in the specific 
asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including 
expenditure on internally generated goodwill is recognised 
in profit or loss as incurred.
(f) Right of use assets and lease liabilities
Leases
The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract 
is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the 
right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration.
Group as a lessee
The Group applies a single recognition and measurement 
approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and 
leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets 
representing the right to use the underlying assets.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 137
Right-of-use assets
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the 
commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the 
underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are 
measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes 
the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct 
costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives received. 
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis 
over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful 
lives of the assets, as follows:
Leased assets Estimated useful lives
Buildings 2-3 years
Towers 2-3 years
If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at 
the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise 
of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are 
also subject to impairment as more fully described in Note 3 
(v)-(iii) - Impairment of Assets.
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Group 
recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of 
lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease 
payments include fixed payments (including in-substance 
fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, 
variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, 
and amounts expected to be paid under residual value 
guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise 
price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating 
the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the 
option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not 
depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses 
(unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the 
period in which the event or condition that triggers the 
payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the 
Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease 
commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement 
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect 
the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is 
remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease 
term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to 
future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate 
used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the 
assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.
The Group’s lease liabilities are included in rights-of-use 
assets and lease liabilities in Note 14.(a) to the Financial 
Statements.
Leases of low-value assets
The Group applies the lease of low-value assets recognition 
exemption to leases of some tower rentals that are 
considered to be low value.Lease payments on leases of 
low-value assets are recognised as expenses on straight -line 
basis over the lease term.
Group as a lessor
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset 
are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms 
and is included in revenue in the statement of profit or loss 
due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in 
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added 
to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised 
over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. 
Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in 
which they are earned.
(g) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the 
weighted average cost principle.Value of inventories includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring, conversion costs and other 
costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and 
condition.
(h) Share capital
Ordinary Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share 
options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any 
tax effects.
(i) Government grants
Government grants are recognised initially at fair value when 
there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and 
the Group will comply with the conditions associated with 
the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses 
incurred are recognised in the statement of Profit or Loss 
and Other Comprehensive Income as other income on a 
systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses 
are recognised. Grants that compensate the Group for the 
cost of an asset are recognised in the of profit or loss on a 
systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.
(j) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit 
plan under which contributions are made into a separate 
fund and the entity will have no legal or constructive 
obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for 
contributions to defined contribution plan are recognised as 
an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods 
during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a 
cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.
138 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
Employees’ Provident Fund
All employees of the Company are members of the Sri Lanka 
Telecom Provident Fund to which the Company contributes 
15% of such employees’ basic salary and allowances.
All employees of subsidiaries of the Group are members of 
Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), to which the respective 
subsidiaries contribute 12% of such employees’ basic salary 
and allowances. Employees of Sri lanka Telecom (Services) 
Limited are members of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF), 
where the company contribute 15% of such employees’ basic 
salary and allowances.
Employees’ Trust Fund
The Company and other subsidiaries contribute 3% of the 
salary of each employee to the Employees’ Trust Fund.
(ii) Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan 
other than a defined contribution plan. The defined benefit 
is calculated by an independent actuary using Projected Unit 
Credit method as recommended by LKAS 19 “Employee 
Benefits” The present value of the defined benefit obligation 
is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows using the yield on Government Bonds at the 
reporting date and have maturity dates approximating to the 
terms of the Company’s obligations.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses that arise 
in calculating the Group’s obligation in respect of a plan 
in other comprehensive income. The present value of the 
defined benefit obligation depends on a number of factors 
that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number 
of assumptions. Key assumptions used in determining the 
defined retirement benefit obligations are given in Note 28. 
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying 
amount of defined benefit obligations.
Provision has been made for retirement gratuities from the 
first year of service for all employees, in conformity with 
LKAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. However, under the Payment 
of Gratuity Act No.12 of 1983, the liability to an employee 
arises only on completion of five years of continued service.
(iii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when 
the Group is demonstrably committed, without realistic 
possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either 
terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or 
to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made 
to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits 
for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if 
the Group has made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it is 
probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of 
acceptances can be estimated reliably.
(iv) Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an 
undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service 
is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid 
under short-term cash bonus or leave encashment plans if 
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to 
pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the 
employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
(k) Revenue from contracts with customers
The Group is primarily involved in providing a broad 
portfolio of telecommunication services across Sri Lanka. 
In addition, the range of services provided by the Group 
include, inter allia, voice and broadband services, domestic 
and international leased circuits, broadband, satellite up-link, 
maritime transmission, IPTV service, directory publishing 
service and educational services.
Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when 
control of the goods or services are transferred to the 
customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to 
which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those 
goods or services. The Group has generally concluded that it 
is the principal in its revenue arrangements.
(i)  Performance obligations relevant to contacts
As a telecommunication service provider, the Group’s 
performance obligation related to service contracts include 
the installation services and maintenance services provided 
and the uninterrupted telecommunication service which will 
be provided throughout the connection period.
The Group expects that above performance obligations 
would be satisfied throughout the connection period.
Domestic and international call revenue and rental income
Fixed lines
Revenue for call time usage by customers is recognised as 
revenue as services are performed on accrual basis. Fixed 
rental is recognised as income on a monthly basis in relation 
to the period of services rendered.
Mobile revenue
Mobile revenue comprises amounts charged to customers in 
respect of monthly access charges, airtime usage, messaging, 
and the provision of other mobile telecommunications 
services. Mobile monthly access charges are invoiced and 
recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle. Air time, either 
from contract customers as part of the invoiced amount or 
from prepaid customers through the sale of prepaid cards, 
is recorded in the period in which the customer uses the 
service.
Revenue from other network operators and international 
settlements
The revenue received from other network operators, 
local and international, for the use of the Group’s 
telecommunication network are recognised, net of taxes, 
based on usage taking the traffic minutes/per second rates 
stipulated in the relevant agreements and regulations and 
based on the terms of the lease agreements for fixed rentals.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 139
Revenue arising from the interconnection of voice and 
data traffic between other telecommunications operators is 
recognised at the time of transit across the Group’s network 
and presented on gross basis. The relevant revenue accrued 
is recognised under income in the Income Statement and 
interconnection expenses recognised under operating costs 
in profit or loss.
Revenue from broadband
Revenue from Data services and IPTV services is recognised 
on usage and the fixed rental on a monthly basis when it is 
earned net of taxes, rebates and discounts.
Revenue from other ICT services
The revenue from other telephone services are recognised 
on an accrual basis based on fixed rental contracts entered 
between the Group and subscribers.
Recognision of deferred income
The connection fees relating to Public Switch Telephone 
Network (PSTN) are deferred over a period of 15 years. 
Revenue is recognised on an annual basis irrespective of the 
date of connection.
IRU revenue relating to leasing of SEA-ME-WE 4 cable 
capacity are recognised on a straight line basis over the 
period of the contracts. Amounts received in advance for any 
services are recorded as deferred revenue. In the event that a 
customer terminates an IRU prior to the expiry of the contract 
and releases the Company from the obligation to provide 
future services, the remaining unamortised deferred revenue 
is recognised in the period the contract is terminated.
Backhauling revenue which is leasing of SEA-ME-WE 3 cable 
capacity is recognised on a straight line basis over the period 
of contracts. Amounts received in advance for any services 
are recorded as deferred revenue.
Revenue from the sale of prepaid CDMA cards is deferred 
until such time as the customer uses the call time, 
downloadable quota or the credit expires.
Sale of mobile recharge cards and reloads for prepaid 
subscribers are initially recognised as deferred revenue until 
such time as the subscribers use the services or credit period 
expires.
CDMA revenue
The connection fees relating to Code Divisional Multiple 
Access (CDMA) connections are recognised as revenue at the 
point the connection is activated.
(ii)  New connection fees
The Group provides installation services relevant to the new 
connections of fixed and mobile telecommunication services 
including both voice and non-voice categories. These 
installation services are bundled together with providing 
of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) to customers 
in fixed line voice and some non-voice services. When 
the performance obligations relevant to such installation 
services are performed, CPEs provided to customers are 
considered as assets of the Group as long as the contracts 
with customers are valid. Accordingly, the Group allocates a 
bundled price for the equipment and installation services for 
such facilities.
(iii)  Recognision of contract liabilities
The Group concluded that revenue from new connections 
in fixed and mobile telecommunication services is to be 
recognised over time because the customer simultaneously 
receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group. 
The fact that another entity would not need to reperform 
the installation of the service that the Group has provided to 
date demonstrates that the customer simultaneously receives 
and consumes the benefits of the Group’s performance as it 
performs.
The Group identifies the revenue for installation services as a 
contract liability and recognises the revenue on a systematic 
basis that is consistent with the entity’s transfer of the related 
goods or services to the customer since satisfaction for the 
installation services will be consumed by the customer over 
the contract period.
(iv)  Costs incurred in securing customer contracts
The Group identifies the sales commission paid to sales team 
for each new connection contract and other such related 
costs in contract acquisition as costs incurred in securing 
customer contracts.
(v)  Recognision of contract assets
Contract acquisition costs are recognised as a contract asset 
and subsequently recognised as an expense over the life of a 
contract on a systematic basis consistent with the pattern of 
the transfer of services to which the asset relates, that is; as 
and when the relevant performance obligation is fulfilled for 
a given month.
(l)  Expenditure
The expenses are recognised on an accrual basis. All 
expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business and 
in maintaining property, plant and equipment in a state of 
efficiency is charged against income in arriving at the profit 
for the year
(m)  Lease payments
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are 
apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction 
of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated 
to each period during the lease term so as to produce a 
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of 
the liability.
Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revising 
the minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the 
lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed. Determining 
whether an arrangement contains a lease.
140 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines 
whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A 
specific asset is the subject of a lease if fulfillment of the 
arrangement is dependent on the use of that specific asset. 
An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the 
arrangement conveys to the Group the right to control the 
use of the underlying asset.
(n)  Finance income and expenses
The Group’s finance income and finance cost include:
> Interest income from repurchase agreements
> Interest income from fixed deposits
> Staff loan interest income
> Interest expense from borrowings
> Interest expense arising from Leases
> Foreign exchange gains or losses
Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective 
interest method. Dividend income is recognised in profit 
or loss on the date on which the Group’s right to receive 
payment is established.
(o)  Income tax
Current income tax assets are measured at amount to be 
recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities
(i)  Current taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognised or profit or loss except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly 
in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity or other 
comprehensive income.
Provisions for taxation is based on the profit for the year 
adjusted for taxation purposes in accordance with the 
provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 and the 
amendments thereto.
(ii)  Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised 
for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition 
of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss and differences relating to investments in nor 
taxable profit or loss and differences relating to investments 
in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred 
tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is 
measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied 
to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current 
tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity 
or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current 
tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets 
liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax 
is not recognised for the undistributed profits of subsidiaries 
as the Parent Company has control over the dividend policy 
of its subsidiaries and distribution of those profits. Deferred 
tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the 
related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or 
loss, is recognised either in other comprehensive income or 
directly in Statement of Changes in Equity in line with the 
underlying transaction.
(iii)  Economic Service Charge (ESC)
ESC is payable on the liable turnover at specified rates. 
As per the provision of the Economic Service Charge Act 
No. 13 of 2006 and subsequent amendments thereto, ESC 
is deductible from the income tax liability. Any unclaimed 
payment can be carried forward and set off against the 
income tax payable as per the relevant provision in the Act.
With effective from 1 January 2020 the Act mentioned above 
was abolished.
(iv)  Sales tax
Revenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the 
amount of sale tax, except: where sales tax incurred on a 
purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the 
taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised 
as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of 
expense item as applicable.
(v)  Uncertainty over income tax treatment
The Group determines whether to consider each uncertain 
tax treatment separately or together with one or more other 
uncertain tax treatments and uses the approach that better 
predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.
The Group applies significant judgment in identifying 
uncertainties over income tax treatments and it assessed 
whether the interpretation had an impact on its consolidated 
Financial Statements.
If the Group concludes that it is probable that the taxation 
authority will accept the tax treatment used or planned to be 
used in its tax fillings, the entity determines its tax position 
on that basis. This is consistent with the requirement that 
current tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid 
or recovered from the taxation authorities, and that deferred 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 141
tax is measured using the rates and tax laws expected to 
apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled.
If the Group concludes that acceptance of the uncertain tax 
treatment by the taxation authorities is not probable, it would 
apply one of the following two methods for reflecting the 
effect of uncertainty in its estimate of the amount it expects 
to pay or recover from the tax authorities
a.  the most likely amount - the single most likely amount in 
a range of possible outcomes; or
b.  the expected value - thesum of the probability-weighted 
amounts in a range of possible outcomes.
The Group uses the method that is expects to better predict 
the resolution of the uncertainty.
(p)  Earnings per share
The Group presents basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) data for 
its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the 
profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the 
company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determinated by adjusting the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted-
average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the 
effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
(q)  Insurance reserve
The Company transfers annually from the retained earnings 
an amount equal to 0.1% of additions to property, plant 
and equipment to an insurance reserve. An equal amount is 
invested in a sinking fund to meet any funding requirements 
for potential losses from uninsured property, plant and 
equipment. The insurance reserve is maintained to recover 
any losses arising from damage to property, plant and 
equipment, except for motor vehicles, that are not insured 
with a third party insurer.
(r)  Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is 
recognised as a liability in the Group’s Financial Statements 
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
Provision for final dividends is recognised at the time the 
dividend recommended and declared by the Board of 
Directors, is approved by the shareholders.
(s)  Comparatives
Except when a standard permits or requires otherwise, 
comparative information is disclosed in respect of the 
previous period. Where the presentation or classification of 
items in the Financial Statements are amended, comparative 
amounts are reclassified unless it is impracticable.
(t)  Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows has been prepared using the 
‘indirect method’ of preparing cash flows in accordance with 
the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard (LKAS 07) – ‘Statement 
of Cash Flows’. Cash and Cash equivalents comprise short-
term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant 
risk of change in value. The cash and cash equivalent include 
cash in hand, balances with banks, placements with banks, 
money at call and short notice.
(u)  Non-current assets held for sale
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups 
as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered 
principally through a sale transaction rather than through 
continuing use. Non-current assets and disposal groups 
classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell 
are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal 
of an asset (disposal group), excluding finance costs and 
income tax expense.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as 
met only when the sale is highly probable, and the asset or 
disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present 
condition. Actions required to complete the sale should 
indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale 
will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. 
Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset 
and the sale expected to be completed within one year from 
the date of the classification.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not 
depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. 
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented 
separately as current items in the statement of financial 
position.
Additional disclosures are provided in Note 22.
(v)  Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and 
judgements
In the preparation of these Financial Statements, a number of 
estimates and assumptions have been made relating to the 
performance and the financial position of the Group. Results 
may differ significantly from those estimates under different 
assumptions and conditions. The Directors consider that the 
following discussion addresses the Company’s most critical 
accounting policies, which are those that are most important 
to the presentation of its financial performance and position. 
These particular policies require subjective and complex 
judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates 
about the effect of matters that are uncertain.
(i)  Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
The Company assigns useful lives and residual values to 
property, plant and equipment based on periodic studies 
of actual asset lives and the intended use for those assets. 
Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, 
142 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
prospective economic utilisation and physical condition of 
the assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives or 
residual values differing from initial estimates.
Where the Company determines that the useful life of 
property, plant and equipment should be shortened or 
residual value reduced, it depreciates the net carrying 
amount in excess of the residual value over the revised 
remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation 
expense. Any change in an asset’s life or residual value is 
reflected in the Company’s Financial Statements when the 
change in estimate is determined.
(ii)  Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets
The Company assesses the impairment of property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting 
standards. Factors that are considered important and which 
could trigger an impairment review include the following;
a.  obsolescence or physical damage;
b.  significant changes in technology and regulatory 
environments;
c.  significant underperformance relative to expected 
historical or projected future operating results;
d.  significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy 
for its overall business;
The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of 
future cash flows and the determination of the recoverable 
amount for assets or cash generating units require significant 
judgement.
(iii)  Revenue recognition
Judgement is required in assessing the application of the 
principles of revenue recognition in respect of revenues. This 
includes presentation of revenue as principal or as agent 
in respect of income received from transmission of content 
provided by third parties.
(iv)  Valuation of receivables
The provision for impairment losses for trade and other 
receivables reflects the Company’s estimates of losses arising 
from the failure or inability of customers to make required 
payments. The provision is based on the ageing of customer 
accounts, customer credit-worthiness and the Company’s 
historical write-off experience etc. Changes to the provision 
may be required if the financial condition of its customers 
improves or deteriorates. An improvement in financial 
condition may result in lower actual write-offs.
(v) Inventories
The Company assesses the inventory provision whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable or otherwise as required by 
accounting standards. Factors that are considered important 
and which could trigger an impairment review include the 
following;
a.  obsolescence or physical damage;
b.  significant changes in technology and regulatory 
environments;
c.  significant changes in the use of its assets or the strategy 
for its overall business;
(vi) Current tax and deferred tax
Judgement was required to determine the total provision for 
current, deferred and other taxes due to uncertainties that 
exist with respect to the interpretation of the applicability 
of tax law at the time of the preparation of these financial 
statements.
Certain uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation 
of tax regulations and the amount and timing of future 
taxable income. Differences arising between the actual 
results and the assumptions made, or future changes to 
such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to 
tax income and expense already recorded. Where the final 
tax outcome of such matters is different from the amounts 
that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the 
income and deferred tax amounts in the period in which the 
determination is made.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, 
based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
(vii) Leases-estimating the incremental borrowing rate
The Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit 
in the lease, therefore, it uses its incremental borrowing 
rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of 
interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over a 
similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary 
to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use 
asset in a similar economic environment. The IBR therefore 
reflects what the Group “would have to pay”, which requires 
estimation when no observable rates are available or when 
they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions 
of the lease. The Group estimates the IBR using observable 
inputs such as market interest rates when available and is 
required to make certain entity-specific estimates as well.
(viii) Revenue recognision from contracts with customers
Judgement is required in assessing the application 
of the principles of revenue recognition in respect of 
revenues.Certain contracts with customers are bundled 
packages that may include sale of products and 
telecommunications services that comprise voice, data, and 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 143
other telecommunications services. The Group accounts 
for individual products and services separately as separate 
performance obligations if they are distinct promised 
goods and services. The Group exercises judgements in 
determining whether a product is distinct, that is, if such 
product or service is separately identifiable from other items 
in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from 
it separately. This determination will affect the allocation 
of consideration specified in the contract and the revenue 
recognised for each performance obligation.
(ix)  Assets held for sale
On 14 December 2021, the Group publicly announced the 
decision of its Board of Directors to sell SLT Campus (Pvt) Ltd, 
a wholly owned subsidiary. Operations of SLT Campus (Pvt) 
Ltd are classified as a disposal group held for sale. The Board 
considered the subsidiary to meet the criteria to be classified 
as held for sale at that date for the following reasons:
> SLT Campus (Pvt) Ltd is available for immediate sale and 
can be sold to the buyer in its current condition
> The actions to complete the sale were initiated and 
expected to be completed within one year from the date 
of initial classification
> A potential buyer has been identified and negotiations as 
at the reporting date are at the conclusion stage.
> The shareholders approved the plan to sell on 14 
December 2021. For more details refer to Note 22. 
(w)  Amendments to existing accounting standards
The Group applied for the first-time certain amendments, to 
existing accounting standards, which are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. The Group 
has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or 
amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
(i) Amendments to SLFRS 16 Leases: Covid-19-Related 
Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021
In 4 December 2020, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued Covid-19-Related Rent 
Concessions - amendment to SLFRS 16 Leases. The 
amendments provide relief to lessees from applying SLFRS 
16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent 
concessions arising as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 
pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not 
to assess whether a Covid-19 related rent concession from 
a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this 
election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting 
from the Covid-19 related rent concession the same way 
it would account for the change under SLFRS 16, if the 
change were not a lease modification. The amendment was 
intended to apply until 30 June 2021, but as the impact of 
the Covid-19 pandemic is continuing, in 28 June 2021, CA 
Sri Lanka extended the period of application of the practical 
expedient to 30 June 2022.The amendment applies to 
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2021. 
(ii)  Amendments to SLFRS 9, LKAS 39, SLFRS 7, SLFRS 4 and 
SLFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 1 and 2
IBOR reform Phase 1
In 15 January 2021, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued amendments to SLFRS 
9, LKAS 39 and SLFRS 7 due to Interest Rate Benchmark 
Reform (Phase 1). A summary of Phase 1 amendments are as 
follows:
> Highly Probable Requirement: According to SLFRS 9 and 
LKAS 39, when a forecast transaction is designated as a 
hedged item, that transaction must be highly probable 
to occur. By the Phase 1 amendments, when determining 
whether a forecast transaction is highly probable, an 
entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on 
which the hedged cashflows are based is not altered as a 
result of the reform
> Prospective assessments: A hedging relationship qualifies 
for hedge accounting only if there is an economic 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument (described in SLFRS 9) or the hedge is 
expected to be highly effective in achieving off-setting 
(described in LKAS 39). An entity must demonstrate 
such prospective assessments on a regular basis. By the 
Phase 1 amendments, when performing prospective 
assessments, an entity shall assume that the interest rate 
benchmark on which the hedged item, hedged risk and/
or hedging instrument are based is not altered as a result 
of the interest rate benchmark reform
LKAS 39 retrospective assesment: To apply hedge 
accounting under LKAS 39, an entity must demonstrate that 
the actual results of the hedge are within a range of 80% - 
125%. This requirement is commonly known as the ‘LKAS 39 
retrospective assesment’. By the Phase 1 amendments, an 
entity is not required to undertake the LKAS 39 retrospective 
assesment for hedging relationships directly affected by 
the reform. However, the entity must comply with all other 
LKAS 39 hedge accounting requirements, including the 
prospective assesment
> Separately identifiable risk components: While there 
are some differences between SLFRS 9 and LKAS 
39 regarding designation of risk components, both 
Standards require a risk component (or a portion) to 
be separately identifiable to be eligible for hedge 
accounting. An entity may designate an item in its 
entirety or a component of an item as a hedged item in 
a hedging relationship. SLFRS 9 and LKAS 39 require the 
component to be separately identifiable to qualify as a 
hedged item. By the Phase 1 amendments, for hedges 
of non-contractually specified benchmark component 
of interest rate risk, an entity shall apply the separately 
identifiable requirement only at the inception of such 
hedging relationships

IBOR reform Phase 2
In addition to Phase 1 amendments, CA Sri Lanka also issued 
amendments to SLFRS 9, LKAS 39, SLFRS 7, SLFRS 4 and 
SLFRS 16 due to Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. The Phase 
2 amendments provide temporary reliefs which address the 
financial reporting effects when an interbank offered rate 
(IBOR) is replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free interest 
rate (RFR). The amendments include the following practical 
expedients 
> A practical expedient to require contractual changes, or 
changes to cash flows that are directly required by the 
reform, to be treated as changes to A floating interest 
rate, equivalent to A movement in A market rate of 
interest
> Permit changes required by IBOR reform to be made to 
hedge designations and hedge documentation without 
the hedging relationship being discontinued.
> Provide temporary relief to entities from having to meet 
the separately identifiable requirement when an RFR 
instrument is designated as a hedge of a risk component
The effective date of both IBOR reform Phase 1 and Phase 2 
amendments is for annual reporting periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2021 in the Sri Lankan context
The requirements under phase 1 amendments have to be 
applied retrospectively. However, the reliefs only apply 
to hedging relationships that existed at the beginning of 
the reporting period in which an entity first applies those 
requirements or were designated thereafter, and to the 
amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve that 
existed at the beginning of the reporting period in which 
an entity first applies those requirements. It follows that it 
is not possible to apply the reliefs retrospectively to hedge 
relationships that were not previously designated as such
The requirements under phase 2 amendments have to 
be applied retrospectively. Hedge relationships are not 
designated retrospectively. However, discontinued hedging 
relationships must be reinstated if, and only if,
> The hedging relationship was discontinued solely due 
to changes required by the Reform, and, therefore, the 
entity would not have been required to discontinue that 
hedging relationship if the Phase 2 Amendments had 
been applied at that time and
> At the date of initial application of the Phase 2 
Amendments, that discontinued hedge relationship 
continues to meet all the qualifying criteria for hedge 
accounting, after taking account of the Phase 2 
Amendment.
These amendmends had no material impact on the financial 
statements. We intend to apply these amendments in future 
periods if they become applicable.
(x) Standards issued but not yet effective
The new and amended standards and interpretations that are 
issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the 
Group’s Financial Statements are disclosed below. The Group 
intends to adopt these new and amended standards and 
interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective.
(i)  SLFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts - In 8 January 2020, 
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA 
Sri Lanka) issued SLFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (SLFRS 
17). SLFRS 17 was amended by Amendments to SLFRS 
17 - Insurance Contracts, in 28 June 2021. SLFRS 17 is a 
comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance 
contracts covering recognition and measurement, 
presentation and disclosure. Once effective, SLFRS 17 
will replace SLFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (SLFRS 4) that 
was issued in 2005. SLFRS 17 applies to all types of 
insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance 
and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that 
issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial 
instruments with discretionary participation features. A 
few scope exceptions will apply. The overall objective of 
SLFRS 17 is to provide an accounting model for insurance 
contracts that is more useful and consistent for insurers. In 
contrast to the requirements in SLFRS 4, which are largely 
based on grandfathering previous local accounting 
policies, SLFRS 17 provides a comprehensive model for 
insurance contracts, covering all relevant accounting 
aspects. The core of SLFRS 17 is the general model, 
supplemented by:
> A specific adaptation for contracts with direct 
participation features (the variable fee approach)
> A simplified approach (the premium allocation approach) 
mainly for short-duration contracts
SLFRS 17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2023, with comparative figures 
required. Early application is permitted, provided the entity 
also applies SLFRS 9 and SLFRS 15 on or before the date it 
first applies SLFRS 17.
SLFRS 17 - Insurance contracts is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements.”
(ii) Amendments to LKAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities 
and Contingent Assets : Onerous Contracts – Costs of 
Fulfilling a Contract
In 25 March 2021, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued amendments to LKAS 37 
Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets 
(LKAS 37) to specify which costs an entity needs to include 
when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. 
The amendments apply a “directly related cost approach”. 
The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 Annual Report 2021 | 145
or services include both incremental costs and an allocation 
of costs directly related to contract activities. General and 
administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract 
and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to 
the counterparty under the contract. The amendments are 
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2022. Earlier application is permitted.
This amendment is not expected to have a significant impact 
on Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
(iii) Amendments to LKAS 16 Property, Plant & Equipment : 
Proceeds before Intended Use
In 25 March 2021, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of 
Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued LKAS 16 Property, Plant and 
Equipment — Proceeds before Intended Use, which prohibits 
entities deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant 
and equipment, any proceeds from selling items produced 
while bringing that asset to the location and condition 
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner 
intended by management. Instead, an entity recognizes the 
proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing 
those items, in profit or loss
The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2022 and must be applied 
retrospectively to items of property, plant and equipment 
made available for use on or after the beginning of the 
earliest period presented when the entity first applies the 
amendment
This amendment is not expected to have a significant impact 
on Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
(iv) Amendments to SLFRS 3 Business Combinations : 
Updating a reference to conceptual framework
In 23 March 2021, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued amendments to SLFRS 
3 Business Combinations - Updating a Reference to the 
Conceptual Framework. The amendments are intended to 
replace a reference to the Framework for the Preparation 
and Presentation of Financial Statements, issued in 1989, 
with a reference to the Conceptual Framework for Financial 
Reporting issued in March 2018 without significantly 
changing its requirements.
An exception was also added to the recognition principle of 
SLFRS 3 to avoid the issue of potential ‘day 2’ gains or losses 
arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be 
within the scope of LKAS 37 or IFRIC 21 Levies, if incurred 
separately
At the same time, it was decided to clarify existing guidance 
in SLFRS 3 for contingent assets that would not be affected 
by replacing the reference to the Framework for the 
Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements
The amendments are effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 and apply 
prospectively. This amendment is not expected to have 
a significant impact on Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements.”
(v)  SLFRS 1 First-time Adoption of Sri Lanka Financial 
Reporting Standards – Subsidiary as a first-time adopter
As part of its 2018-2020 annual improvements to SLFRS 
standards process, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued an amendment to SLFRS 
1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards (SLFRS 1). The amendment permits a subsidiary 
that elects to apply paragraph D16(a) of SLFRS 1 to measure 
cumulative translation differences using the amounts 
reported by the parent, based on the parent’s date of 
transition to SLFRS. This amendment is also applied to an 
associate or joint venture that elects to apply paragraph 
D16(a) of SLFRS 1. The amendment is effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with 
earlier adoption permitted. This amendment is not expected 
to have a significant impact on Group’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
(vi) SLFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Fees in the ’10 per cent’ 
test for derecognition of financial liabilities
As part of its 2018-2020 annual improvements to SLFRS 
standards process, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued an amendment to SLFRS 
9 Financial Instruments (SLFRS 9). The amendment clarifies 
the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the 
terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially 
different from the terms of the original financial liability. 
These fees include only those paid or received between the 
borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received 
by either the borrower or lender on the other’s behalf. An 
entity applies the amendment to financial liabilities that 
are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of 
the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies 
the amendment. The amendment is effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with 
earlier adoption permitted.
This amendment is not expected to have a significant impact 
on Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
(vii) LKAS 41 Agriculture – Taxation in fair value 
measurements
As part of its 2018-2020 annual improvements to SLFRS 
standards process, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) issued an amendment to LKAS 
41 Agriculture (LKAS 41). The amendment removes the 
requirement in paragraph 22 of LKAS 41 that entities exclude 
cash flows for taxation when measuring the fair value of 
assets within the scope of LKAS 41. An entity applies the 
amendment prospectively to fair value measurements on 
146 | Sri Lanka Telecom PLC
or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period 
beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with earlier adoption 
permitted.
This amendment is not expected to have a significant impact 
on Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
4.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the 
establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management 
framework.
The Group’s risk management processes are established 
to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set 
appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and 
adherence to limits. Risk management systems are reviewed 
regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the 
group activities.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors 
compliance with the Group’s risk management processes/
guidelines and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the 
risk management framework in relation to the risks. The Audit 
Committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal reviews 
of risk management controls and procedures. The results of 
which are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of 
financial instruments:
> Credit risk, Liquidity risk and Market risk
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to 
each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives , policies and 
processes for measuring and managing risk and the Group’s 
management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are 
included throughout these financial statements.
4.1.  Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a 
customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligation, and arise principally from the 
Group’s receivables from customers.
Carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum 
credit exposure
4.1.1  Trade receivables
The group having a very well established credit policy for 
both International Interconnect customers and Domestic 
customers to minimize the credit risk. A separate committee 
has been established to evaluate and recommend the credit 
worthiness for the International Interconnect customer. 
Further, Prepaid sales are used as a means of mitigating 
credit risk
Domestic service is offered to a new customer only after 
scrutinizing through a internal blacklisted data base. The 
group has a well-established credit control policy & process 
to minimize the credit risk. Customers are categorised 
according to the segments and credit limit has been fixed 
as per their average monthly bill value. Customer usage and 
bill payments are monitored as per the credit limit. Credit 
limit will be periodically revised as per the past monthly 
bill value. High risk voice customers are subjected to auto 
disconnection when they reached the threshold limit. Credit 
control actions and recovery actions are taken for the 
overdue customers and defaulted customers to minimise 
the credit risk. High revenue generated customers including 
corporate customers are monitored individually.
As at 31 December, the maximum exposure to credit risk for 
trade by geographic region was as follows:

4.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTD.
4.2  Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities 
that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as 
possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, 
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The group ensures its liquidity is maintained by investing in short, medium and long-term financial instruments to support 
operational and other funding requirements. The group determines its liquidity requirements by the use of both short and 
long-term cash forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding 
adequacy for at least a 12-month period and the same is reviewed on an annual basis.
Short and medium-term requirements are regularly reviewed and managed by the Treasury Division.
Contractual undiscounted payments the Sri Lanka Telecom PLC would be called upon to make under the issued Corporate 
Guarantee Contracts on behalf of its subsidiaries are as follows,

4.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTD.
4.3  Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which will 
affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to 
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
4.3.1  Currecny risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on services provided, services received and borrowings that are denominated in a 
currency other than the Sri Lankan rupees (Rs.) 
The Group manages its currency risk by a natural hedging mechanism to a certain extent by matching currency outflows for 
repayments of foreign currency loans and services with currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies.
The summary of quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to foreign currency was as follows:

Sensitivity analysis
A reasonable possible strengthening (weakening) USD would have an impact on the Group’s borrowings. This analysis assumes 
that all other variables, in particular interest rates remain constant.

4.3.2  Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk mainly arises as a result of Group having interest sensitive assets and liabilities, which are directly, impacted 
by changes in the interest rates. The Group’s borrowings and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest 
rate instruments and periodical maturity gap analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse 
impact due to volatility of the interest rates. 
To minimise the adverse impact of variable interest rate borrowings due to an upward movement of USD interest rates in the 
market, the Company has obtained an interest rate SWAP and arrangements are being made to obtain an interets rate CAP .
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operations while long-term interest rate management 
decisions require approval from the Board of Directors.
Interest rate sensitivity of the company was computed within the floor interest rate (Minimum) of 2.5% as stipulated in the loan 
agreement. The Group interest rate sensitivity was computed based on a 100 basis point increase or decrease. This analysis 
assumes that all other variables, in particular, foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The sensitivity of interest rate 
movement is shown below;

4.4  Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. Capital consists of stated capital and reserves The Board of Directors monitors the return 
on capital as well as the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

5.  OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Group has three reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic divisions. The strategic 
divisions offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and 
marketing strategies for each of the strategic divisions, the Board of Directors, (the Chief Operating Decision Maker-CODM) 
reviews internal management reports on at least quarterly basis. The following summary describes the operations in each of 
the Group’s reportable segments.
> Fixed ICT operations includes supply of fixed telecommunication services.
> Mobile ICT operations includes supply of mobile telecommunication services.
> Other segment operations includes directory publication and support services. None of these segments meet the 
quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2021 or 2020.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment 
profit before tax. As included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors (BOD). Segment 
profit is used to measure performance as Management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the 
results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.

8   REFUNDS ON TELECOMMUNICATION DEVELOPMENT  CHARGE (TDC)
In accordance with the Finance Act No. 11 of 2004, all Telecommunication Gateway Operators are required to pay a levy 
defined as the Telecommunication Development Charge (TDC) to the Government of Sri Lanka, based on international call 
minutes terminated in the country. This levy was   made effective from 03 March, 2003 where initially the levy was defined in 
such a way that Operators were allowed to claim the 2/3rd of the TDC against the costs of network development charges.
The TDC Refund received in 2014 corresponds to the period from April 2009 to July 2010 which was the last claim obtained 
under the respective regulation. As the said regulation was received with effect from July 2010 while eliminating the 
reimbursement process, the final claim requested from TRC applicable for the above period was received in year 2014.
First revision to this regulation was introduced with effect from 15 July, 2010 with an International Telecommunication 
Operators Levy (ITOL) TDC rate change from USD cents 3.80 to USD cents 1.50. Through the same revision, the disbursement 
process of TDC was removed from the regulation. As stated above the revised ITOL rate prevailed until such time the rate was 
revised to USD cents 3.00 per minute with effect from January 2012, in accordance with the Budget Proposal for 2012 and 
ITOL rate was further revised again to USD cents 6.00 per minute with effect from January 2016 in accordance with the Budget 
Proposal for 2016.

Hedging activities         
The Group is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The Group uses foreign currency-
denominated borrowings to manage some of its transaction exposures. The primary risks managed using hedging activities is 
the foreign currency risk.
The Group’s risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage foreign currency risk are explained in Note 4.3.1.
There is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments as there is an opposite relationship 
between currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies which are generated from day-to-day business operations 
and currency outflows for repayments of foreign currency loans which are on fixed terms.
The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the foreign exchange are 
identical to the hedged risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method 
and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the changes in fair value of the hedged items 
attributable to the hedged risks.
The hedge ineffectiveness can arise from:
> Differences in the timing of the cash flows of the hedged items and the hedging instruments
> Changes to the forecasted amount of cash flows of hedged items and hedging instruments
13 EARNINGS PER SHARE

The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows:
 Group  Company 
2021 2020 2021 2020 
Discount rate  (long-term) - % 10.6 - 11.6 8.0-10.0 10.6 8.0

Expected average working life of employees - Years 11.7 -13.4 9.9-12.3 13.4 12.3
Retirement age of the employees - Years 55-60 55-60 55-60 55-60
In addition to above, demographic assumptions such as mortality, withdrawal, retirement age were considered for the actuarial 
valuation. In 2021,1967/70 Mortality Table issued by the Institute of Actuaries London (2020 - 1967/70 Mortality Table) was 
taken as the base for the valuation.
The provisions for defined obligations of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC,SLT Digital Info Services  (Private) Limited, Sri Lanka Telecom 
(Services) Limited,SLT Campus (Private) Limited,SLT Visioncom (Private) Limited, Talentfort (Private) Limited and Mobitel 
(Private) Limited , are actuarially valued by Messrs Actuarial and Management Consultants (Private) Limited and Messrs Piyal S 
Goonetilleke and Associates respectively.
The provision for defined benefit obligations is not externally funded.  
Sensitivity analysis
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions 
constant,  would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amount shown below.
The sensitivity of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and the statement of financial position is the 
effect of the assumed changes in discount rate and salary increment rate as depicted in the following table.

carrying amounts lastly due to the short term maturities of these investments.       
  
Fair value of trade and other payables and borrowings have been arrived by discounting gross values by the year end AWFDR rate.

financial Assets and Liabilities that have a short term maturity, it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate their fair 
values. 
Fixed rate financial instruments

rates when they were first recognized with current market rates for similar financial instruments
Variable rate financial instruments

variable rate instruments.

38 IMPACT OF COVID 19 - PANDEMIC
Significant unusual items affecting assets, liabilities, equity, net income or cash flows
The telecommunication service has been categorised as an essential service by the Government of Sri Lanka. With the 
responsibility to provide an uninterrupted service to the nation, SLT as the national telecommunications provider activated its 
Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”) and effected changes in operations, supply chain, workforce movements, investments and 
strategies to cope with the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The below summarises our strategy and the response plan for the pandemic situation:
(a)   Uninterrupted service to the nation while keeping people safe
As the national telecommunications and mobile services provider, SLT Group provided an uninterrupted service to the nation 
during this challenging period. SLT Group ensured customer service through digital platforms to minimize human contact and 
maintained social distancing and safety regulations in customer points. SLT Group shifted most of the employees to Work from 
Home and the employees who perform their duties in office premises/ field were allowed to work under strict health and safety 
guidelines while maintaining social distancing regulations. During the years 2020 and 2021, SLT created a fund to mitigate the 
cost of hospitalization, set up three intermediatory quarantine centers and provided home care medical facilities for detected 
SLT employees and their immediate family members. However, considering the new guidelines issued by the Government of 
Sri Lanka on Covid-19 management practices, SLT revised its Covid-19 incident handling protocol in the new normal situation 
and presently continues only with the provision of home care medical facilities. 
(b)   Direction of operations for the need of the hour 
As a response to the need of the hour, SLT together with its mobile arm Mobitel provided innovative yet affordable data 
packages to meet the growing customer demand and introduced easy payment terms for corporate customers. With the 
shift towards work from home arrangements and study from home arrangements, the Group experienced a positive impact in 
revenue in areas such as Broadband, PEOTV and Career Business services due to surge in utilization in both residential and 
business sectors. Further, future opportunities are emerging with novel digital products and services. 
(c)    Liquidity management 
The effective collection strategies of the Group coupled with the need for continuous supply of telecommunication services 
improved collections over the period. The Group prioritised capital expenditure for critical projects, which included projects 
which provide connectivity to rural areas to narrow the digital divide in the Country. However, the recent depreciation of the Sri 
Lankan rupee against the US dollar adversely impacted the cash flows of the Group. Further, the foreign currency liquidity issue 
prevailing in the domestic foreign exchange market poses challenges to project payments in foreign currency.
(d)   Impact on property, plant and equipment
The Group has assessed the impact on property, plant and equipment and spectrum assigned to the Group and does not 
foresee impairment due to the pandemic. 
The Group will continue to take proactive measures to mitigate any potential impact and will continue its contingency plans 
and risk management measures as the situation evolves. 
There were no other events or transactions that require disclosures or adjustments to the financial statements for the period 
ended 31 December 2021.

39 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING DATE

be imposed on companies that have earned a taxable income in excess of LK Rs. 2,000 million for the year of assessment 
2020/2021. The proposed tax should be deemed an expenditure in the financial statements relating to the year of assessment
