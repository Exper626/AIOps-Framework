[{"prompt": "What are the key steps in configuring a PE device for BGP peering with a CE router?","response": "The key steps include: 1) Defining the BGP process with a router ID and AS number. 2) Establishing neighbor relationships with CE routers using their IP addresses and AS numbers. 3) Configuring address families (IPv4/IPv6) and enabling network advertisements. 4) Applying route maps or filters to control route exchange. 5) Verifying peering status with commands like 'show ip bgp summary'."},{"prompt": "How do you configure a VRF instance on a PE device for customer traffic isolation?","response": "To configure a VRF: 1) Create the VRF using 'ip vrf [name]' and assign a route distinguisher (RD). 2) Associate interfaces connected to CE devices with the VRF using 'ip vrf forwarding [name]'. 3) Configure routing protocols (e.g., BGP, OSPF) within the VRF address family. 4) Ensure route targets (RTs) are set for import/export of routes between PE and CE."},{"prompt": "What considerations are required when configuring OSPF between a PE and CE device?","response": "Key considerations: 1) Ensure the PE and CE are in the same OSPF area. 2) Redistribute CE routes into BGP on the PE and vice versa. 3) Use 'capability vrf-lite' on the PE to support VRF-aware OSPF. 4) Set appropriate metrics and route tags to prevent loops. 5) Configure sham links to avoid backdoor paths in multi-homed CE setups."},{"prompt": "How do you secure PE/CE interfaces in a service provider network?","response": "Security measures include: 1) Applying access control lists (ACLs) to filter unauthorized traffic. 2) Enabling BGP prefix limits to prevent route overflow attacks. 3) Using route filtering with prefix lists or route maps. 4) Disabling unused interfaces and enabling port security. 5) Implementing authentication for routing protocols (e.g., MD5 for BGP)."},{"prompt": "What is the role of route distinguishers (RDs) in PE device configuration?","response": "Route distinguishers (RDs) uniquely identify IPv4 prefixes within a VRF by appending the RD to the prefix, creating a VPNv4 address. This allows PE devices to support overlapping IP addresses across different customers while maintaining routing separation in the provider network."},{"prompt": "How do you configure redundant PE devices for CE connectivity?","response": "Redundancy can be achieved via: 1) BGP multihoming, where the CE connects to multiple PEs and uses BGP for path selection. 2) HSRP/VRRP on CE devices for default gateway redundancy. 3) Configuring equal-cost multipath (ECMP) routing on the PE. 4) Ensuring consistent VRF configurations across all redundant PEs."},{"prompt": "What are the best practices for troubleshooting PE/CE connectivity issues?","response": "Best practices: 1) Verify physical and Layer 2 connectivity between PE and CE. 2) Check routing protocol adjacencies (e.g., BGP, OSPF) using 'show ip [protocol] neighbor'. 3) Validate VRF routing tables with 'show ip route vrf [name]'. 4) Use 'ping' and 'traceroute' within the VRF context. 5) Review BGP route propagation and route target configurations."},{"prompt": "How do you configure static routes on a PE device for CE traffic?","response": "Steps: 1) Use 'ip route vrf [VRF-name] [destination-network] [mask] [next-hop]' to define static routes. 2) Ensure the next-hop IP belongs to the CE device in the same VRF. 3) Redistribute static routes into BGP using 'redistribute static' under the BGP address family. 4) Verify routes with 'show ip route vrf [name]'."},{"prompt": "What is the purpose of route targets (RTs) in PE/CE configurations?","response": "Route targets (RTs) control the import and export of routes between VRFs on PE devices. They determine which routes are shared with other PE devices or CE routers. RTs are configured using extended BGP communities and are essential for enabling connectivity between sites in an MPLS VPN."},{"prompt": "How do you optimize QoS policies on PE devices for CE traffic?","response": "Optimization steps: 1) Classify CE traffic using ACLs or DSCP markings. 2) Define traffic policies with class-based shaping/policing. 3) Apply policies to PE device interfaces facing the CE. 4) Prioritize critical traffic (e.g., VoIP) with low-latency queuing. 5) Monitor traffic using NetFlow or SNMP to adjust policies dynamically."}]
