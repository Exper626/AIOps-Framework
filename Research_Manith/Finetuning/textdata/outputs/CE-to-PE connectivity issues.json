[{"prompt":"What are common causes of BGP session failures between CE and PE routers, and how can they be resolved?","response":"Common causes include IP reachability issues, BGP parameter mismatches (e.g., AS numbers, authentication keys), or interface misconfigurations. Verify IP connectivity, check BGP neighbor configurations (remote-as, update-source), and ensure authentication matches. Use commands like 'show ip bgp summary' and 'ping' to diagnose."},{"prompt":"How do you troubleshoot MTU mismatches affecting CE-to-PE connectivity?","response":"Check interface MTU settings on both CE and PE devices. Use 'show interfaces' to confirm MTU values. If mismatched, adjust MTU sizes to match end-to-end. For MPLS networks, ensure the MTU accommodates encapsulation overhead (e.g., 1500 bytes for standard Ethernet)."},{"prompt":"What steps should be taken if a CE router is not receiving routes from the PE via OSPF?","response":"Verify OSPF neighbor adjacency with 'show ip ospf neighbor'. Ensure area IDs and network types match. Check for route filtering via distribute-lists or prefix-lists. Confirm the PE is redistributing routes into OSPF and the CE has proper route-targets or VRF configurations."},{"prompt":"Why might a CE-to-PE link show 'up/down' status, and how can it be fixed?","response":"An 'up/down' status indicates a Layer 2 issue. Check physical cabling, SFP modules, and speed/duplex settings. Ensure VLAN tagging (if used) matches on both ends. Validate switchport configurations and check for errors like CRCs using 'show interfaces status' and 'show interfaces [interface]'"},{"prompt":"How do VLAN configurations impact CE-to-PE connectivity, and what should be verified?","response":"Mismatched VLAN IDs or trunking settings can block traffic. Confirm the CE and PE interfaces are configured for the same VLAN (access mode) or allow the VLAN on trunks. Use 'show vlan brief' and 'show interfaces trunk' to validate configurations."},{"prompt":"What role do route-targets play in CE-to-PE connectivity, and how are they configured?","response":"Route-targets control route exchange in MPLS VPNs. Ensure the CE's VRF route-targets match the PE's import/export policies. Use 'show ip vrf [vrf-name]' to verify route-targets and 'show bgp vpnv4 unicast all' to check route propagation."},{"prompt":"How can ACLs or firewalls disrupt CE-to-PE connectivity, and what should be checked?","response":"ACLs may block BGP (TCP 179) or routing protocol traffic. Review ACL entries on both CE and PE, ensuring permitted protocols and ports. Use 'show access-lists' and packet captures to identify dropped traffic. Temporarily disable ACLs for testing if safe."},{"prompt":"What are common Layer 1 issues in CE-to-PE links, and how are they diagnosed?","response":"Cabling faults, incorrect transceivers, or interface errors (e.g., CRCs) can cause failures. Check 'show interfaces' for errors, test cabling with a TDR, and verify SFP compatibility. Ensure interfaces are administratively up and speed/duplex settings match."},{"prompt":"How do you resolve a CE router failing to advertise routes to the PE via BGP?","response":"Confirm the CE's BGP process is configured to advertise networks via 'network' statements or redistribution. Check for route maps or prefix-lists filtering routes. Use 'show ip bgp' to verify routes are present and 'show ip bgp neighbors [PE-IP] advertised-routes' to confirm propagation."},{"prompt":"What impact does a misconfigured VRF have on CE-to-PE connectivity, and how is it fixed?","response":"A misconfigured VRF may prevent route exchange or packet forwarding. Verify the CE and PE VRFs share the same RD/RT values and that interfaces are assigned to the correct VRF. Use 'show ip vrf' and 'show ip bgp vpnv4 all' to validate VRF routing tables."}]
