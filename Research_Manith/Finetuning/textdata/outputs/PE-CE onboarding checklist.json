[{"prompt":"What are the essential steps in a PE-CE onboarding checklist?","response":"The essential steps include gathering customer requirements, verifying network topology, configuring PE and CE devices, setting up routing protocols (BGP, OSPF), applying security policies (ACLs, firewalls), testing connectivity, documenting configurations, and conducting post-deployment validation."},{"prompt":"How do you configure BGP between PE and CE routers during onboarding?","response":"To configure BGP between PE and CE, establish a neighbor relationship using the neighbor command, advertise networks via network statements or redistribution, configure route maps or prefix lists for filtering, set BGP timers, and verify adjacency with commands like 'show ip bgp summary'."},{"prompt":"What security measures should be implemented on PE-CE links?","response":"Security measures include applying access control lists (ACLs) to filter traffic, configuring firewall rules, using encryption (IPsec if required), enabling BGP authentication (MD5), disabling unused ports, and implementing route filtering to prevent unauthorized route announcements."},{"prompt":"How to verify Layer 3 connectivity after PE-CE onboarding?","response":"Use ping and traceroute commands from CE to PE and vice versa. Check routing tables on both devices to ensure routes are learned correctly. Use 'show ip route' and 'show ip bgp' commands to validate route propagation."},{"prompt":"What documentation is critical for PE-CE onboarding?","response":"Critical documentation includes network topology diagrams, IP address allocation plans, device configuration files, contact information for stakeholders, SLA details, routing protocol parameters, and any change management records."},{"prompt":"What are common issues encountered during PE-CE routing configuration?","response":"Common issues include IP address mismatches, incorrect subnet masks, routing protocol misconfigurations (e.g., wrong AS number in BGP), ACLs blocking routing updates, MTU mismatches, and physical layer connectivity problems."},{"prompt":"How to configure VLANs on PE-CE links?","response":"Configure the PE and CE interfaces as trunk or access ports as per design. Assign VLAN IDs consistently on both ends. Use 'switchport mode trunk' or 'switchport mode access' commands. Verify VLANs with 'show vlan brief' and ensure 802.1Q tagging is applied if needed."},{"prompt":"What QoS policies should be applied on PE-CE interfaces?","response":"Define traffic classes using class-maps, create policy-maps to set bandwidth limits, priorities, and marking (e.g., DSCP values). Apply the policy to PE-CE interfaces using the 'service-policy' command. Monitor with 'show policy-map interface'."},{"prompt":"How to ensure MTU compatibility between PE and CE devices?","response":"Check the MTU size on both PE and CE interfaces using 'show interfaces'. Ensure both ends are configured with the same MTU value (e.g., 1500 for standard Ethernet). Adjust with 'mtu' command on interfaces if necessary."},{"prompt":"What redundancy mechanisms are recommended for PE-CE connections?","response":"Implement BGP multipath for load balancing, use HSRP or VRRP for gateway redundancy, configure multiple PE-CE links with routing protocol failover, and ensure physical diversity in the connections."},{"prompt":"How to perform initial health checks on PE-CE devices before onboarding?","response":"Verify device hardware and software compatibility, check for sufficient memory and CPU resources, ensure firmware and OS are up-to-date, validate interface statuses with 'show interfaces', and confirm that management access (SSH, SNMP) is configured."},{"prompt":"What steps are involved in route filtering between PE and CE?","response":"Define prefix lists or route maps to control route advertisement. Apply them inbound or outbound on the routing protocol configuration. For BGP, use 'neighbor route-map' commands. Validate with 'show ip route' and 'show ip bgp' to ensure filtering works."},{"prompt":"How to configure static routes between PE and CE?","response":"Use the 'ip route' command on CE pointing to PE's interface IP as next-hop, and vice versa if needed. Ensure subnets are correctly specified. Verify with 'show ip route' and test connectivity."},{"prompt":"What logging and monitoring should be set up for PE-CE links?","response":"Enable SNMP traps, configure syslog servers for event logging, set up NetFlow or sFlow for traffic monitoring, use BFD for fast failure detection, and implement interface-level counters with 'show interfaces' for performance tracking."},{"prompt":"How to handle time synchronization between PE and CE devices?","response":"Configure NTP servers on both PE and CE devices using 'ntp server' commands. Ensure time zones are set correctly and verify synchronization with 'show ntp associations' and 'show clock'."},{"prompt":"What are the best practices for managing configuration changes during PE-CE onboarding?","response":"Use version-controlled configuration templates, implement change management procedures, schedule changes during maintenance windows, test configurations in a lab environment first, and back up configurations before applying changes."},{"prompt":"How to validate DNS settings during PE-CE onboarding?","response":"Ensure DNS servers are reachable from both PE and CE networks. Test DNS resolution using 'nslookup' or 'dig' commands. Verify that DNS entries for network devices are correctly configured in the DNS server."},{"prompt":"What post-deployment checks should be performed after PE-CE onboarding?","response":"Monitor for stability over a period, verify all applications perform as per SLA, check for any residual errors in logs, confirm that all security policies are enforced, and validate that documentation reflects the deployed configuration."},{"prompt":"How to configure OSPF between PE and CE routers?","response":"Enable OSPF on PE and CE interfaces, set the same area ID on both ends, configure network statements to include interfaces in OSPF, set appropriate hello/dead timers, and verify adjacency with 'show ip ospf neighbor'."},{"prompt":"What considerations should be made for IPv6 in PE-CE onboarding?","response":"Ensure interfaces have IPv6 addresses configured, enable IPv6 routing, configure BGP or OSPFv3 for IPv6 route exchange, apply IPv6 ACLs, verify neighbor discovery with 'show ipv6 neighbors', and test IPv6 connectivity end-to-end."}]
