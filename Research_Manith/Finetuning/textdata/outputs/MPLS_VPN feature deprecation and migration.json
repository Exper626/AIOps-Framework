  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do vendor-specific MPLS/VPN deprecation policies impact migration planning?",
    "response": "Vendor policies dictate end-of-support dates, available migration incentives, and compatibility with replacement solutions, directly influencing project timelines and budgets."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What role does network virtualization play in replacing traditional MPLS/VPN deployments?",
    "response": "Network virtualization enables logical overlays that abstract from physical MPLS circuits, allowing flexible, policy-driven connectivity via IPsec or GRE tunnels."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What are the key considerations for maintaining compliance during MPLS/VPN migration?",
    "response": "Ensure new solutions meet regulatory requirements for data encryption, access controls, audit logging, and maintain compliance documentation during and after migration."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How can automation streamline the transition from legacy MPLS/VPN to modern architectures?",
    "response": "Automation can handle configuration conversion, validate policy consistency, and orchestrate failover testing, reducing human error and accelerating deployment."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What are the risks of delaying migration from a deprecated MPLS/VPN solution?",

  },
  {
    "prompt": "How should organizations approach testing after migrating from MPLS/VPN to a new framework?",
    "response": "Test scenarios should validate end-to-end connectivity, QoS policies, failover mechanisms, and security postures across all migrated segments before final cutover."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What documentation updates are necessary post-MPLS/VPN migration?",
    "response": "Update network topology diagrams, security policies, runbooks, and asset inventories to reflect new architectures and decommissioned MPLS/VPN components."
