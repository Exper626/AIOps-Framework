[{"prompt": "What are the common causes of VPN reachability issues in enterprise networks?","response": "Common causes include misconfigured routing tables, firewall rules blocking tunnel protocols, authentication failures, network congestion, MTU mismatches, expired certificates, incorrect IPsec/IKE settings, and ISP-level restrictions. Physical infrastructure issues like faulty hardware or high latency can also disrupt connectivity."},{"prompt": "How can I troubleshoot a site-to-site VPN that intermittently drops connections?","response": "Check for unstable physical links, verify tunnel keepalive settings, review firewall logs for dropped packets, analyze MTU size consistency across sites, inspect router CPU/memory usage, and validate phase 1/phase 2 negotiation parameters. Use packet captures to identify where the failure occurs."},{"prompt": "What steps resolve a 'no response from remote server' error when connecting to a remote access VPN?","response": "Verify client internet connectivity, confirm correct server IP/FQDN and port accessibility, check firewall/NAT rules for UDP 500/4500, validate client authentication credentials, test with different client software, and ensure server-side services (e.g., OpenVPN, IPSec) are running."},{"prompt": "Why might a VPN connection establish but fail to route traffic properly?","response": "This typically indicates a routing misconfiguration. Check route tables for proper destination networks, verify split tunnel vs. full tunnel settings, ensure correct subnet masks, confirm NAT exemptions are configured, and validate that the remote network's firewall allows traffic from the VPN client's IP range."},{"prompt": "How do firewall settings impact VPN reachability?","response": "Firewalls may block required protocols (e.g., ESP, AH, UDP 500/4500), restrict traffic through NAT without proper port forwarding, or drop fragmented packets. Stateful inspection might not recognize tunnel traffic unless configured with appropriate application-layer gateways (ALGs) for protocols like IPsec or GRE."},{"prompt": "What network diagnostic tools help identify VPN reachability problems?","response": "Use ping/traceroute to test end-to-end connectivity, Wireshark/tcpdump for packet analysis, 'show crypto session'/'show ipsec sa' commands on Cisco devices, 'ip route' to verify routing tables, and 'nmap' to check port availability. Vendor-specific tools like Palo Alto's Packet Capture or Fortinet's Sniffer also help."},{"prompt": "How does MTU size affect VPN connectivity?","response": "Excessive MTU sizes can cause fragmentation, especially in IPsec tunnels that add overhead. This leads to packet drops if intermediate devices don't handle fragmentation properly. Reduce MTU to 1400-1472 bytes on tunnel interfaces and ensure consistent settings across all devices to prevent path MTU discovery issues."},{"prompt": "What authentication methods commonly cause VPN connection failures?","response": "Common issues include expired or mismatched pre-shared keys, invalid client/server certificates (e.g., expired, untrusted CA), incorrect username/password credentials, misconfigured RADIUS/TACACS+ servers, and certificate revocation list (CRL) check failures. Verify time synchronization for certificate validation."},{"prompt": "How can I resolve split tunneling conflicts affecting VPN reachability?","response": "Check the split tunnel configuration to ensure only required networks are routed through the tunnel. Disable 'block local' settings if accessing local resources, verify route metrics prioritize the correct interfaces, and ensure DNS settings direct queries to appropriate servers based on traffic type."},{"prompt": "What role does NAT play in causing VPN connectivity issues?","response": "NAT can break VPNs by modifying packet headers that IPsec/SSL encrypts, causing HMAC validation failures. Configure NAT traversal (NAT-T) for IPsec, ensure proper port forwarding for tunnel protocols, and use NAT exemptions for encrypted traffic. Avoid double-NAT scenarios between tunnel endpoints."}]
