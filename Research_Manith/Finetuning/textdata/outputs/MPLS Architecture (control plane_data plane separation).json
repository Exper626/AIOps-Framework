[{"prompt": "Explain the concept of control plane and data plane separation in MPLS architecture.", "response": "In MPLS, the control plane and data plane are functionally separated. The control plane handles label distribution, routing decisions, and path setup using protocols like LDP, RSVP-TE, or MP-BGP. The data plane performs label-based packet forwarding using the Label Forwarding Information Base (LFIB), which is populated by the control plane. This separation enables efficient traffic engineering and scalable network management."},
{"prompt": "What are the key benefits of separating control and data planes in MPLS networks?", "response": "Separating control and data planes in MPLS provides three primary benefits: 1) Scalability through reduced per-packet processing, 2) Flexibility for traffic engineering via centralized path control, and 3) Protocol independence allowing multi-service support (IP, Ethernet, etc.). This separation also simplifies network troubleshooting and enables faster convergence during topology changes."},
{"prompt": "Which protocols operate in the MPLS control plane and what are their roles?", "response": "The MPLS control plane uses three main protocols: 1) Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) for dynamic label exchange, 2) Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) for constraint-based path setup, and 3) Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) for VPN label distribution. These protocols establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and populate the Label Information Base (LIB) used by the data plane."},
{"prompt": "How does the data plane forward packets in an MPLS network?", "response": "The MPLS data plane forwards packets using label switching. When a packet enters an LSP, the ingress Label Edge Router (LER) imposes a label. Each subsequent Label Switching Router (LSR) performs label swapping based on its LFIB, which maps incoming labels to outgoing interfaces and new labels. The penultimate hop removes the label (PHP) before delivering the packet to the egress LER."},
{"prompt": "What happens during control plane failure in an MPLS network?", "response": "A control plane failure in MPLS disrupts label distribution and path maintenance but doesn't immediately affect existing data plane forwarding. Forwarding continues using the last programmed LFIB entries until label bindings time out (typically 15-60 seconds). During this period, traffic may be black-holed if alternate paths aren't pre-established through protocols like RSVP-TE fast reroute."},
{"prompt": "Compare traditional IP routing with MPLS forwarding in terms of plane integration.", "response": "Traditional IP routing integrates control and data planes through hop-by-hop destination-based forwarding using IGP protocols. MPLS decouples these planes: the control plane establishes explicit LSPs using label distribution protocols, while the data plane performs table lookups based on short fixed-length labels. This allows MPLS to support traffic engineering and quality of service mechanisms not possible with conventional IP routing."},
{"prompt": "How does MPLS control plane establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs)?", "response": "The control plane establishes LSPs through three steps: 1) Path discovery using routing protocols (OSPF/IS-IS) to determine topology, 2) Label binding and distribution via LDP or RSVP-TE to create FEC-label mappings, and 3) LSP setup confirmation across all participating LSRs. This creates the forwarding state stored in each router's LFIB for data plane operations."},
{"prompt": "What is the role of Label Information Base (LIB) and Label Forwarding Information Base (LFIB) in MPLS?", "response": "The LIB (control plane) stores all learned label bindings from neighboring LSRs, including incoming and outgoing label mappings. The LFIB (data plane) contains the active label forwarding entries programmed from the LIB. Only the best paths selected by the control plane are installed in the LFIB for actual packet forwarding operations."},
{"prompt": "How does MPLS separation of planes improve network convergence?", "response": "Control/data plane separation improves convergence by allowing the control plane to independently calculate and distribute new forwarding paths while the data plane continues forwarding using existing LFIB entries. This enables mechanisms like LDP IGP synchronization and RSVP-TE fast reroute to maintain traffic flow during control plane reconvergence, reducing packet loss and downtime."},
{"prompt": "Explain penultimate hop popping (PHP) in the context of MPLS data plane operations.", "response": "Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) is a data plane optimization where the second-to-last LSR in an LSP removes the label before forwarding to the egress LER. This reduces processing overhead at the egress router by eliminating an unnecessary label lookup. PHP is enabled by implicit null label allocation during LDP session establishment between adjacent LSRs."}]
