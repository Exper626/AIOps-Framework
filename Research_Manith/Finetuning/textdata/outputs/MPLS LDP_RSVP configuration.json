[{"prompt": "What are the basic steps to configure MPLS LDP on a Cisco router?", "response": "Enable CEF with 'ip cef', enable MPLS on interfaces with 'mpls ip', and configure LDP using 'mpls ldp router-id' and 'mpls ldp neighbor' commands if needed."},
{"prompt": "How do you configure RSVP for traffic engineering in an MPLS network?", "response": "Enable RSVP on interfaces with 'mpls traffic-eng tunnels', define an explicit path using 'explicit-path', create a tunnel with 'interface tunnel', and assign the path using 'tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-option'."},
{"prompt": "What are the key differences between LDP and RSVP in MPLS?", "response": "LDP automatically creates LSPs based on routing tables, while RSVP allows explicit path control for traffic engineering. RSVP supports bandwidth reservation and QoS, whereas LDP focuses on label distribution for dynamic paths."},
{"prompt": "How do you verify LDP neighbor adjacency?", "response": "Use 'show mpls ldp neighbors' to check established adjacencies and 'show mpls ldp sessions' to verify session status and label bindings."},
{"prompt": "What commands troubleshoot RSVP LSP setup failures?", "response": "Use 'show mpls traffic-eng tunnels' to check tunnel status, 'show ip rsvp reservation' for resource allocations, and 'debug rsvp' to trace signaling errors."},
{"prompt": "How to configure LDP over RSVP tunnels?", "response": "Enable LDP on the tunnel interface with 'mpls ip', ensure RSVP tunnels are configured with 'tunnel mode mpls traffic-eng', and verify with 'show mpls ldp bindings'."},
{"prompt": "What security features are available for LDP and RSVP?", "response": "LDP supports MD5 authentication for neighbor sessions. RSVP uses cryptographic authentication with pre-shared keys to secure signaling messages."},
{"prompt": "Explain graceful restart in LDP and RSVP.", "response": "Graceful restart allows LDP/RSVP to maintain forwarding state during control-plane restarts. Enable with 'mpls ldp graceful-restart' and 'mpls traffic-eng graceful-restart' respectively."},
{"prompt": "How does load balancing differ between LDP and RSVP?", "response": "LDP supports per-destination load balancing, while RSVP allows per-flow load balancing based on traffic engineering policies and explicit paths."},
{"prompt": "How to configure explicit paths in RSVP?", "response": "Define an explicit path with 'explicit-path name <path-name> enable', specify next-hop nodes with 'next-address', and assign it to a tunnel using 'tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-option'."},
{"prompt": "What are LDP label allocation methods?", "response": "LDP uses downstream unsolicited (DU) or downstream on-demand (DoD) label allocation. DU is default, where labels are advertised without requests."},
{"prompt": "What RSVP message types are critical for signaling?", "response": "PATH messages establish LSPs from sender to receiver, while RESV messages reserve resources in reverse. PATH-ERR and RESV-ERR handle error propagation."},
{"prompt": "How to optimize LDP convergence?", "response": "Use LDP IGP synchronization to delay label distribution until LDP sessions are up, and enable LDP-IGP backoff timers to prevent flapping."},
{"prompt": "What parameters define RSVP bandwidth reservation?", "response": "Configure bandwidth with 'tunnel mpls traffic-eng bandwidth <kbps>' and priority with 'tunnel mpls traffic-eng priority <setup-hold-priority>' to control resource allocation."},
{"prompt": "How to disable PHP in an MPLS LDP network?", "response": "Use 'no mpls ip penultimate-hop-popping' on the egress router to prevent label popping and ensure proper payload handling."},
{"prompt": "What is LDP session protection and how is it configured?", "response": "LDP session protection maintains label bindings during neighbor outages. Enable with 'mpls ldp session protection' and configure a backup path using a static route or IGP."},
{"prompt": "How to monitor RSVP hello messages?", "response": "Use 'show ip rsvp hello' to verify hello message exchanges between RSVP neighbors and ensure session liveness."},
{"prompt": "What is the role of liberal vs. conservative label retention in LDP?", "response": "Liberal retention stores all labels received from neighbors (default), while conservative retention stores only labels from the next-hop router to save memory."},
{"prompt": "How to configure LDP over GRE tunnels?", "response": "Enable MPLS on the GRE tunnel interface with 'mpls ip', ensure LDP is active on the interface, and verify with 'show mpls ldp neighbors'."},
{"prompt": "What are RSVP policy controls and how are they applied?", "response": "RSVP policy controls use AAA or local policies to restrict LSP setup. Apply with 'tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-selection' to filter based on administrative groups or affinity masks."}]
