non-current. Key points include: (1) A right to defer settlement must exist at the reporting period end, (2) Classification remains unaffected by the likelihood of exercising deferral rights, (3) Embedded derivatives in convertible liabilities only avoid impacting classification if they qualify as equity instruments. These amendments ensure consistent application but had no impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.","rejected":"The amendments to LKAS 1 are about some accounting rules for liabilities.
