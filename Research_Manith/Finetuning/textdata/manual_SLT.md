Unparalleled Reach
As the National Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) 
solutions provider, SLT provides the 
backbone for island-wide connectivity 
and communications. Bolstering around 
9 million subscribers for fixed mobile and 
ICT services, the Company’s commitment 
also extends to empowering the 
telecommunications value-chain, and 
delivering innovative products and services 
that improve the lives of millions more. 
Customers include individual and domestic 
consumers, enterprise customers ranging 
from SMEs to multinationals and large 
enterprises, essential services and public 
sector institutions, and other operators. 
In the field of entertainment, SLT’s IPTV 
offering - PEOTV, has the largest library of 
High-Definition (HD) content in Sri Lanka 
and is the only provider of local freeto-air channels in HD aired through the 
PEOTV platform.



Ensuring that all Sri Lankans are seamlessly 
connected with world-class information, 
communication and entertainment 
services, is enshrined in our vision. At the 
heart of this commitment, is the extension 
and maintenance of Sri Lanka’s robust 
communications infrastructure, and 
provision of vital access to digital products 
and services.
National Backbone Network 
(NBN)
SLT’s advanced fibre optic network serves 
as the backbone of Sri Lanka’s digital 
communications and connectivity. Our fibre 
optic transport network extends almost 
65,000 km and includes over 1.2 million 
FTTH ports across the entire island. 
This state-of-the-art network ensures 
high-speed, high-capacity, low-latency 
connectivity for millions of Sri Lankans



As the Nation’s largest IP network, SLT’s 
infrastructure encompasses multiple100 
Gbps backbone, metro rings, and further 
access rings. This robust network with over 
500 high-capacity nodes for seamless 
connectivity and 4,500 service segregation 
nodes delivers intelligent IP transport 
services for various platforms. These 
support SLT’s retail products (Broadband, 
PEOTV, 4G, and Wi-Fi) while also connecting 
government, enterprises, and other 
domestic and international segments.




n today’s interconnected world, reliability 
and security of the networks that undergird 
all digital and ICT functions, are paramount. 
Recognising the critical role of our network, 
we have incorporated comprehensive 
security like enabling an intelligent 
Automatically Switched Optical Network 
(ASON), and providing a 1+2 redundancy 
system to ensure reliable operation.
Meeting Future Connectivity 
Needs
The world is constantly evolving, and as 
Sri Lanka embraces new technologies like 
artificial intelligence, Internet of Things 
(IoT), cloud computing, and upgrades 
to wireless cellular technology such as 
5G, the need for robust, high-speed 
connectivity becomes critical. As a National 
digital enabler, SLT is geared to embrace 
opportunities and meet the varying needs 
of a rapidly changing environment.
SLT connects Sri Lanka to the world through 
five international submarine cable systems: 
SEA-ME-WE 3, SEA-ME-WE 4, SEA-MEWE5, Bharat Lanka, and Dhiraagu-SLT. As 
the globalised work environment expands 
and service exports become a key driver of 
Sri Lanka’s digital economy, we are outfitting 
our networks and infrastructure to meet 
the foreseen rise in communication and 
data needs. The potential for growth in the 
horizon is contingent upon the activation 
of capacity following the completion of 
the expansion of SEA-ME-WE 5. Similarly, 
a recent upgrade of SEA-ME-WE 4, with a 
capacity increase from 65Tb /s to 122Tb /s, 
positions the cable system to cater to 
increasing bandwidth demands.



The upcoming SEA-ME-WE 6 cable, slated 
for completion in 2025, has a planned 
landing point at SLT’s Matara Cable Landing 
Station. This high-capacity network has a 
design capacity of 10x13 Tbps, of which 
SLT has secured a capacity of 6 Tbps – 
promising high-speed global connectivity 
and capacity for Sri Lanka’s consumers, 
enterprises, and the economy in the years 
to come. Together with SLT’s bolstered 
international backhaul capacity, this global 
platform creates a robust international 



backbone, ensuring reliable and efficient 
data flow for Sri Lanka’s digitalisation 
ambitions and roll-out of new technologies 
such as 5G.
SLT’s network of state-of-the-art data 
centres and multi-cloud offerings will be 
crucial to enabling and meeting the rising 
demand for digital services across the 
Country. We will continue to partner with 
investors and others to pursue set-up of 
additional data centres and installation of 
additional capacity at our existing locations.


#!--

We employ proactive capacity planning 
by analysing historical data and actively 
aligning with government and regulator 
initiatives such as “Connect Sri Lanka”, 
which sought to fulfil country-wide 4G 
and fibre broadband coverage. Following 
directives to phase out 3G and aggressively 
expand 4G coverage, we have continually 
expanded our capacity to match the 
direction of local demand. Where possible, 
we leverage Network Function Virtualization 
(NFVI) infrastructure to provide seamless 
integration without requirement for 
additional hardware.


Emerging Technology and 
Opportunities
Emergence of 5G technology marks 
a revolutionary leap in connectivity. 
Its potential goes beyond faster data 
transfer to a world of applications that 
could transform the way we live, work, 
and interact. With auction of Sri Lanka’s 
5G spectrum on the horizon, SLT has 
embarked on pre-commercial trials of 
5G on a trial license. Pilot projects were 
rolled out across five cities: Colombo, 
Kandy, Galle, Anuradhapura, and 
Jaffna. Enhanced mobile broadband 
and ultra-reliable low latency 
communications (URLLC) have already 
lent themselves to innovative pilot 
ventures, and our teams are preparing 
to explore potential opportunities for 
systemic change through a variety of 
5G applications.

Group Chairman’s Review

Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am 
pleased to present Sri Lanka Telecom PLC’s 
Annual Report for 2023. The year presented 
a complex operating environment, as the 
cumulative effects of economic stressors 
from current and previous years bore down 
on the industry, economy, and customers. 
Macroeconomic challenges facing the 
telecommunication industry impacted 
both demand and supply sides, pressuring 
the Group’s topline and bottom line. 
Further, increase in taxation and electricity 
tariffs had a significant adverse impact on 
industry profitability.

Subdued Group Performance

SLT group reported a Loss After Tax of 
LKR 3.9 Bn. as the Group experienced 
marginal revenue degrowth in the single 
digits. SLT recorded a loss of LKR 1.1 Bn, 
and Mobitel a loss of LKR 3.6 Bn. SLT’s 
operations recorded a growth in revenue of 
3.2% during the year, while Mobitel recorded 
a reduction in revenue of 5.7% YoY.

A Transparent Review of 
Internal Challenges
While the ongoing economic crisis 
has undoubtedly impacted the entire 
telecommunications sector, some 
operators in the industry have navigated 
these challenges more effectively, achieving 
growth during this period. At the same time, 
despite long-standing structural challenges, 
the Group had managed to post profits 
and declare dividends in the previous years. 
Therefore, it is important to acknowledge 
that areas for improvement exist within 
the Group. These include enhancing 
productivity, optimising operating costs to 
be on par with industry peers, improving 
structures and processes, and addressing 
potential leakages. It is also vital that we 
identify, analyse, and address the factors 
that contributed to the Group’s loss during 
the year 2023.
Historically, two factors have contributed 
to the Group’s performance: Firstly, 
Mobitel was efficient and contributed a 
significant portion of Group profits until 
2021. Secondly, until recently, SLT had 
relied on sunken copper investments 
and therefore there was minimal capital 
investment on newer technologies like fibre 
network infrastructure including last-mile 
connections. While the copper network was 
inefficient, it generated sufficient revenue 
to cover costs in the past.
While these factors had contributed to 
creating a fragile profit for the Group 
in the past; a number of decisions 
taken in 2020 and thereafter, 
compounded by a series of untimely 
occurrences, eroded the Group’s 
profit and contributed to the losses 
reported in 2023.
Recognising the challenges ahead, we are 
determined to overcome them through 
decisive action: to improve performance, 
ensure sustainability of the enterprise, 
and create long-term value.


The Group’s Technical Sub-Committee 
(TSC) and Audit Committee (AC) have 
diligently assessed the decisions and issues 
that led to losses experienced during the 
year, and set a course to correct them, 
which I will outline herewith.
1. Deficiencies in capital 
project execution:
A review by the TSC revealed significant 
shortcomings in the execution of key capital 
expenditure projects, including Fibre-ToThe-Home (FTTH), Fixed Wireless Access 
(FWA), Internet-Protocol-Television (IPTV) 
and Internet-Data-Centre (IDC). These 
projects suffered from cost overruns 
significantly exceeding initial projections; 
risks were not adequately assessed or 
factored into planning; excessive upfront 
capital expenditure was made without clear 
long-term return on investment strategies 
in place; and business cases relied on overly 
optimistic Terminal Value (TV) calculations 
to justify project returns - potentially 
inflating their viability.
These issues highlight the need for a more 
rigorous project management and risk 
assessment framework. The Group has 
taken steps to address these concerns: the 
Nomination and Governance Committee 
and Remuneration Committee of the Board 
assisted the CEO to create a new General 
Manager position, reporting to the CEO, 
whose primarily responsibility is to ensure 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). The 
Group has also recruited suitable cadre, 
with international exposure, to fill the 
position. The Board has further designated 
the CEO and CFO as persons accountable 
for ensuring proper project appraisals, 
adherence to approved business cases, and 
regular proactive monitoring to keep the 
Board appraised.
2. Challenges with the Convergent 
Billing Project:
The TSC also identified issues with the 
Group’s single-sourced, technical-led, 
Convergent Billing project. This project was 
intended to streamline billing for bundled 
services. Often considered a Business 
Support System Transformation project in 
the industry, such a project is considered a 
strategic undertaking that has the potential 
to transform every part of the business and 
deliver value to customers and internal and 
external stakeholders. 

However, TSC review has highlighted 
improper planning and deviation from 
industry best practices, which typically 
follow open tender processes and prioritise 
business needs. This has resulted in the 
Board recognising the project as high-risk. 
The Board is therefore actively monitoring 
the project.
3. Elevated costs through lack of 
CPE interoperability:
The AC and Senior Tender Board (STB) 
identified a lack of interoperability between 
Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) 
used for FTTH, which resulted in exorbitant 
prices. In order to address this, the AC and 
STB directed management to address 
the issue, thereby fostering greater 
competition among CPE vendors. This 
initiative successfully reduced CPE costs by 
approximately 50%.
4. Cash flow challenges due to 
funding mismatch and dependence 
on post-paid
The Group’s prior practice of financing 
long-term projects through short-term 
borrowings, has resulted in cash flow issues. 
In addition, an over-reliance on post-paid 
customer billing cycles has slowed down 
cash flow. 
Additionally, the prior practice of capitalising 
customer-specific connection costs (lastmile infrastructure) enabled recording of 
growth in terms of revenues and profits. 
Albeit, this practice placed a tremendous 
burden on cash flows, increased borrowings, 
and caused enormous churn where net 
growth of customers was severely affected.
5. Mobitel’s profitability erosion 
and subscriber churn:
Mobitel’s historical contribution to SLT 
through dividends ceased in FY2022 and 
FY2023, coinciding with a significant decline 
in profitability. Profits of LKR 8 Bn. in 2021 
turned into losses of LKR 120 Mn. in 2022 
and LKR 3.7 Bn. in 2023. This deterioration 
was primarily driven by a customer base 
reduction exceeding 1.3 million over the 
same period. An investigative audit directed 
by the AC identified several causal factors 
for the excessive and unprecedented levels 
of churn contributing to the rapid subscriber 
base decline, which fell from 8.5 million to 
7.2 million between 2022 and 2023

Provision of defective Subscriber Identity 
Modules (SIM) batches by an identified 
supplier caused customer inconvenience, 
resulting in further churn and /or 
necessitating free SIM replacements at 
appreciable inconvenience to customers 
and increased overheads to Mobitel. As part 
of corrective action, Mobitel has ceased 
sourcing from this supplier and is pursuing 
necessary legal action.
Excessive Trade Incentives for customer 
acquisition significantly increased the 
Subscriber Acquisition Cost (SAC), 
which more than doubled compared 
to the previous year. This strategy, 
potentially driven by the need to 
replace defective SIMs, incentivised 
gross additions even through sale of 
new connections existing customers, 
further contributing to churn rates.
Taking immediate action to address these 
issues, from mid-2023 onward Mobitel 
implemented corrective measures in the 
trade incentive scheme that had severely 
burdened the company. In addition, the 
Board decided to not renew the Group 
Chief Executive Officer contract and to 
accept resignation of the Chief Executive 
Officer of Mobitel. Accordingly, the 
Board facilitated a merged-organisation 
structure for the Group with a single Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) – appointing 
Mr. Janaka Abeysinghe to this position to 
lead the unified organisation. As part of 
the merged structure, Mobitel welcomed 
Mr. Sudharshana Geeganage as its new 
Chief Operating Officer (COO).
Marking a Turning Point in 
2023: A Year of Restructure
To navigate the ongoing challenges and 
ensure long-term success of the Group, 
the Board has focused on remedying urgent 
issues, addressing inefficiencies, optimising 
capital expenditure, and streamlining 
operations, as outlined above.
The significant concerns faced by the 
Group in 2023 also necessitated strategic 
course-correction and restructuring. In 
order to drive this shift, in January 2024, the 
Secretary to the Treasury replaced the six 
nominee Directors appointed on behalf of 
the Government of Sri Lanka. I am grateful 
to the Ministry of Finance and the Board of 
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC for placing their trust 
in me to take the helm as Chairman

Looking to 2024: A Year for 
Refocus and Consolidation
Embarking on this journey of 
transformation, we are committed to 
creating a more efficient, agile, and 
cost-effective organisation, which is wellpositioned for future growth.
Following a comprehensive review by the 
Audit Committee, including benchmarking 
against regional best practices for multicompany governance, the Board adopted 
a strategic initiative to consolidate 
and streamline the Group structure. 
This involved establishing effective 
governance frameworks for all privately held 
subsidiaries, ensuring clear accountability 
and performance measurement. The 
streamlined structure was implemented 
in a phased approach and became fully 
operational in March 2024.
Optimising our operations, we are working 
to maximise efficiency across the Group. 
While staff cost-to-revenue ratios are 
currently higher than the industry average, 
the Board is committed to achieving 
sustainable and profitable growth while 
optimising operations to improve these 
metrics. A key element in this endeavour 
is fostering a vibrant performance culture 
across the Group. We are looking to our 
staff to provide exceptional customer 
experiences as a core focus, and will be 
creating necessary structures to enable 
performing staff to reap the benefits. To 
drive this cultural transformation, the Board, 
with the support of the Nomination and 
Governance Committee and Remuneration 
Committee, has appointed a new 
Chief People Officer with international 
experience. This dedicated leader will be 
responsible for implementing strategies 
to enhance staff productivity and build a 
culture of excellence across SLT


We are also pleased to announce successful 
conclusion of litigation related to the 
Dialog-Airtel merger and Radio Access 
Network (RAN) sharing. This outcome 
was achieved through an equitable 
settlement agreement facilitated by 
the Telecommunications Regulatory 
Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL). We 
commend TRCSL’s commitment to fairness 
and a just resolution for all parties involved. 
As a result of this agreement, Mobitel is 
expected to receive significant spectrum 
allocations from TRCSL. This includes 
5MHz of additional Frequency Division 
Duplexing (FDD) spectrum in the sub-1GHz 
low band, and 25MHz of Time Division 
Duplexing (TDD) spectrum in the 2.3GHz 
mid band. This additional spectrum will 
empower Mobitel to deliver an enhanced 
data experience for its customers and 
contribute to Sri Lanka’s digitalisation 
aspirations. Furthermore, the agreement 
addresses the long-standing issue of noncontiguous spectrum allocation, leading 
to improved spectral efficiency and cost 
savings for Mobitel’s wireless business. 
The agreement also includes TRCSL’s 
commitment to facilitate RAN sharing within 
the industry. This would unlock potential 
savings on infrastructure investments that 
will lessen the strain on foreign currency 
reserves and benefit the Group overall. 
This move will also allow for better network 
utilisation and increased capacity, ultimately 
benefiting customers through reduced 
costs and enhanced customer experience.


Conclusion
In closing, I extend my gratitude to the 
former Board Directors who urgently 
and effectively addressed the challenges 
faced by the Group in 2023. I would also 
like to recognise the untiring efforts of our 
dedicated employees who went above and 
beyond in enabling the Group to withstand 
difficult circumstances. I also thank our 
shareholders, esteemed partners, and 
other stakeholders for their unwavering 
commitment and support. We recognise 
the challenges ahead, but I would like to 
reassure you that we are determined to 
overcome them. We are taking decisive 
action to improve performance, ensure 
sustainability of our enterprise, and create 
long-term value for our stakeholders. We 
appreciate your continued support as we 
continue to serve our country and people 
for a better and brighter future.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review


Despite challenges, I am immensely 
proud of the resilience demonstrated 
by the entire team at SLT.


As we reflect on 2023 where countries and 
industries continued to face the pressures 
of a global slowdown, Sri Lanka’s economic 
contraction was felt by all our stakeholders. 
The telecommunications sector had to 
contend with a multitude of challenges 
including rising costs, while responding to 
the needs of customers. These factors, 
combined with rising exchange and 
interest rates, created a complex business 
environment that impacted our operations 
and results.
Despite these headwinds, I am immensely 
proud of the resilience demonstrated by 
the entire team at SLT. From the technical 
staff maintaining and extending critical 
infrastructure, to our customer experience 
teams, we have remained committed to 
delivering an exceptional service to our 
customers.
Navigating headwinds
Escalating costs, particularly the high 
increases in electricity tariffs in 2022 
and again in 2023, coupled with a steep 
escalation in exchange rate significantly 
impacted our business. As a leading digital 
enabler for the nation, high energy cost and 
Annual Maintenance Costs (AMC) involved 
in managing and sustaining vital network 
infrastructure was a major issue to contend 
with, as we continued to build out our 
network, align with connectivity needs of 
customers, and pursue the roll-out of new 
and more advanced technologies.
These factors were compounded by 
the prevalent elevated interest rates 
and inflationary pressures on consumer 
disposable income, which led to a 
higher customer churn-rate 
compared to previous years. 


While we saw a revenue increase of 3.2% 
YoY, operational costs rose by 6%. This 
resulted in a Group-level loss, with SLT 
incurring a loss of LKR 1.1 Bn. and Mobitel 
a loss of LKR 3.6 Bn. The Group Earnings 
Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and 
Amortisation (EBITDA) also reflects these 
challenges.
Cost optimisation was a central focus 
during the year as we successfully managed 
internal costs where possible by maximising 
efficiencies and absorbing costs by adjusting 
the focus of our teams to include certain 
maintenance activities. While external 
factors like license fees, interest rates and 
energy prices remained beyond our direct 
control, consolidation of Annual Maintenance 
Costs (AMC), and continuing investment in 
profitable and revenue generating projects 
contributed to cost-effectiveness and 
cost-benefits that we could extend to 
our customers.
Investing in our employees
The economic environment of 
the last two years brought multiple 
stressors for human resource 
management and talent 
retention for all Sri Lankan 
institutions. Combatting 
talent-flight across various 
professions, we implemented 
proactive initiatives to 


#!--

reinforce SLT’s employee value proposition 
and ultimately attract, retain, and groom 
suitable personnel. These measures 
prioritised review of policies, enriching the 
organisational culture and work experience, 
and strengthening career advancement 
pathways. Our commitment extended to 
leadership development, with the launch of 
SLT’s Executive Development Programme 
in 2023, investing in over 10,000 training 
hours and providing an immersive training 
experience over for 100 key executives.
Expanding our network 
and offering
While we remained committed to 
infrastructure investments to extend reach, 
better serve our customers, and position to 
meet Sri Lanka’s growing digitalisation needs, 
network expansion slowed down in 2023. 
Our investments ranged from development 
of approximately 1.2 million FTTH ports and 
deployment of over 400 new 4G LTE base 
stations, expanding both wired and wireless 
networks across the country. 
Supporting Sri Lanka’s economic recovery, 
we continued to extend reliable, secure, 
and innovative products and services to 
businesses while supporting the digitalisation 
efforts of enterprises, SMEs, and a number 
of government institutions. Our enterprise 
segment saw continued growth in 2023, led 
by noteworthy revenue growth from the SME 
segment, and growth from large enterprise 
business. In line with SLT’s strategy of driving 
a smarter Sri Lanka, and our continued focus 
on empowering Business Segments we 
debuted new cost-effective products and 
expanded our enterprise service offering. 
Recognising the challenges faced by our 
consumers in the aftermath of the economic 
crisis, we delivered a number of innovative 
products and options that increased 
flexibility, affordability, and convenience for a 
wide customer base.
SLT’s wholesale business continues 
to facilitate connectivity demands of 
domestic and international telcos. We 
have also invested in capacity increases 
at data centres and upgraded and 
expanded the wired and wireless network 
infrastructure to accommodate growing 
demand, strengthening our domestic and 
international transport offering.
Additionally, our international business 
and presence remains strong with Xyntac 
establishing a footprint overseas and 
focusing on emerging opportunities 
unlocked by our international cable 



infrastructure. We have invested in the 
SMW6 submarine cable, due to complete 
in 2025, securing capacity that will provide 
high-speed global connectivity for Sri Lanka’s 
consumers, enterprises, and economy in the 
years to come.
Subsidiaries play a vital role in SLT’s overall 
strategy. We continued to develop synergies 
across the Group, while improving standards 
and processes, increasing efficiency, and 
exploring options for consolidation and 
amalgamation. SLTS, our System Integration 
(SI) business, saw significant growth in 
the enterprise space, driven by our focus 
on digital transformation and buoyed 
by strong partnerships with banks and 
leading corporates. 
Transforming our business 
through innovation and 
sustainability
The global telecommunications sector 
continues to evolve and adapt to 
technological advancements and changing 
consumer demands. On par with these 
trends, SLT’s digital and organisational 
transformation to a future-ready technology 
company is encapsulated in our strategy. 
In 2023, the Digital Transformation Division 
continued our digitalisation efforts, 
prioritised internal process improvement, 
and bolstered our capabilities in software 
development, integration, and frontier 
technologies. These undertakings 
culminated in establishment of SLT’s 
dedicated Innovation Group in 2024, which 
includes an R&D lab, which is partnering with 
leading innovators and customers to pilot a 
range of internal and external initiatives.
Sustainability of our operations and 
long-term business model is a priority 
focus area that we strive to integrate 
into business practices. Exercising 
our commitment to environmental 
stewardship, we continued to pursue 
energy efficiency measures and expand 
our renewable energy generation. With 
solar systems now installed at 19 locations, 
and plans in place for solar PV at more than 
200 additional sites with a total capacity 
of 6MW, we expect annual savings of 
approximately LKR 260 Mn. and emissions 
reduction of around 6,300 tCO2e. This 
commitment extends to our office 
facilities, as we are proud to announce 
that the SLT-MOBITEL Operational HQ 
in Welikada was awarded a prestigious 
Platinum green building rating.


Looking to the future
Despite the challenges faced in 2023, we 
are resolutely optimistic about the future 
as Sri Lanka’s economy is expected to 
return to growth in 2024 and evolution 
in the technological landscape indicates 
SLT is well-positioned to lead the way. 
The expected 5G spectrum allocation 
presents a significant opportunity to unlock 
the transformative potential of this nextgeneration 5G technology. We are confident 
our pre-commercial trial and pilot projects 
have equipped us with the knowledge and 
expertise to be a frontrunner in the 5G space, 
particularly for enterprise applications. 
Our robust partner ecosystem, including 
engagement of leading technological 
innovators, will allow us to capitalise on 
emerging opportunities. Meeting the needs 
of Sri Lanka’s evolving digital economy, we 
expect to be at the forefront of supporting 
and rolling out frontier technologies such as 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning 
(ML), Big Data analytics, Internet of Things 
(IoT), and Robotic Process Automation (RPA). 
The strength, reliability, and safety of our 
foundational network infrastructure, provision 
of cloud connectivity and edge computing 
solutions, leveraging of network APIs, and 
innovative SD-WAN enterprise solutions will 
pave the way for a more connected, intelligent, 
and automated future.

Operating Context
Analysing the operational landscape of 
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT), we delve 
into the global economic scenario, the 
international telecommunications and 
technological landscape, and the socioeconomic backdrop of Sri Lanka, coupled with 
anticipated growth in the upcoming year.
The Global Economy
“Global GDP growth is projected to stay 
at 3.1% in 2024 and rise to 3.2% in 2025. 
Elevated Central Bank rates to fight inflation 
and a withdrawal of fiscal support amidst 
high debt weigh on economic activity. 
Inflation is falling faster than expected in 
most regions, amid unwinding supply-side 
issues and restrictive monetary policy. 
Global headline inflation is expected to fall 
to 5.8% in 2024 to 4.4% in 2025, with the 
2025 forecast having been revised down.”, 
as stated by the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF)


#!--


Contrastingly, the World Bank presents 
a sombre outlook for 2024, envisioning 
a third consecutive year of global GDP 
deceleration to 2.4%. This trajectory 
poses a threat to poverty reduction goals, 
potentially hindering efforts to uplift 
vulnerable populations. 

As we approach the midpoint of a transformative decade, the global economy is on track to 
register the slowest half-decade of GDP growth in three decades, as reported by the World 
Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report




The OECD’s latest Economic Outlook projects global GDP growth to reach a mild slowdown 
to 2.7% in 2024 and a slight improvement to 3.0% in 2025. Asia is expected to continue to 
account for the bulk of global growth in 2024 /25, as it has in 2023.
Impact of the Gaza Conflict 
The impact of the conflict on worldwide commodity markets has been relatively contained, 
witnessing only a modest uptick of around 6% in oil prices. The World Bank reports that 
agricultural commodities, the majority of metals, and other commodities have displayed 
minimal fluctuations.
However, the situation might swiftly take a turn for the worse if other Middle Eastern nations 
decide to engage in the conflict. The potential blockage of the Suez Canal alone could result 
in a substantial 12% reduction in global trade. According to the most pessimistic forecasts, 
the outbreak of a direct war involving additional regional countries might elevate global 
inflation by 1.2% and reduce world GDP by 1%.
Global Telecom Industry
Research conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute reveals that the global 
telecommunications sector holds a substantial value of USD 1.5 Tn., contributing to 2.5% 
of the overall global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The study further indicates that this 
sector is experiencing a robust annual growth rate of 5%, surpassing the pace of the global 
economy, with even greater opportunities in the future.
“Driven largely by video traffic, global data consumption over telecom networks will nearly 
triple, from 3.4 Mn. petabytes (PB) in 2022 to 9.7 Mn. PB in 2027. As the transition to 5G 
continues, and newer technological standards gain traction, telcos are projected to invest 
USD 342.1 Bn. in their networks in 2027 alone”. These are among the key findings outlined in 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) first Global Telecom Outlook



Data consumption associated with gaming 
is expected to rise at a 21% Compound 
Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) between 
2022 and 2027, reflecting the continued 
shift towards online and cloud gaming. 
The projected CAGR of around 43% in 
virtual reality (VR) data over the five-year 
time frame will see its share of total data 
consumption reach 5% by 2027, driven 
by the growth of the metaverse. However, 
incomes for telecoms will not improve 
proportionately due to the commoditised 
nature of data, which doesn’t allow for 
differentiating the offer. This holds true for 
telecom operators such as SLT as well.
Impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
on the Industry
The telecommunications industry stands 
at the epicentre of driving widespread 
adoption of advanced technologies, 
primarily propelled by mobile and 5G 
broadband services in the Internet of Things 
(IoT) era. Projections indicate that the global 
AI component in the telecommunications 
market is expected to reach USD 14.99 Bn. 
by 2027, up from USD 11.89 Bn. in 2020, 
with a remarkable CAGR of 42.6% during 
the period 2021-2027




Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a pivotal 
role in this transformative journey, 
influencing various aspects such as: 
network optimisation, automation of 
customer service, integration of virtual 
assistants, predictive maintenance, 
implementation of Robotic Process 



Automation (RPA) for telecommunications 
companies, fraud prevention, and fostering 
revenue growth.
According to McKinsey Global, telcos 
could unlock growth and rejuvenation 
by wholeheartedly adopting extensive 
AI deployment and transitioning into 
organisations that are inherently AI-native. 
Recognising this imperative as nonnegotiable, some telcos are increasing their 
investments in AI, scaling them up as the 
tangible business impact of this technology 
becomes evident. 
Sri Lanka too can expect the 
implementation of such technologies in the 
near future, with SLT playing a crucial role in 
their rollout and adoption.
Sri Lankan Economy
Sri Lanka’s economy is expected to grow 
by 1.7% in 2024 after contracting by 
3.8% in 2023, the World Bank said in its 
twice-a-year update, in January this year. 
Several indicators point to the realisation of 
this optimistic scenario. 
Improved Forex Situation
In December 2023, Sri Lanka’s gross official 
reserves reached USD 4.4 Bn., as per official 
data. This increase was supported by loans 
from multilateral lenders, including the 
International Monetary Fund.


In 2023, remittances to Sri Lanka through 
official channels increased by 57% to 
USD 5.97 Bn., up from USD 3.8 Bn. the 
previous year. This rise was facilitated by a 
better exchange rate following improved 
monetary policy. This marks the highest 
annual inflow from Sri Lankan expatriates 
since 2019.
Sri Lanka’s tourism sector has experienced 
significant growth, with earnings exceeding 
USD 2 Bn. and the arrival of over 1.48 million 
visitors in 2023. This marks the highest 
revenue and visitor influx since 2019. 
Sri Lanka Tourism has set ambitious goals 
for 2024, aiming to attract 2.5 million 
tourists and generate USD 4.6 Bn. in 
revenue. Additionally, the long-term 
strategy aims to increase arrivals to 5 million 
and achieve revenue of USD 21.6 Bn. within 
five years.
Impact of VAT
Many import restrictions of the past 
few years have been lifted, and foreign 
exchange is readily accessible. While 
the exchange rate remains elevated, 
there is room for improvement in the 
importation of communication devices 
by individuals, corporates, as well as the 
telecommunications industry. However, 
the Government’s announcement of an 
increase in the value added tax (VAT) from 
15% to 18% has resulted in corresponding 
increments in taxes on Mobile, Mobile 
Broadband, Fixed Broadband, Pay 
Television, and value-added services. This 
adjustment has the potential to affect 
revenue, particularly from users of more 
premium services.
While the worst days of inflation are over, 
increase in the value added tax (VAT) and 
the resultant rise in overall costs could drive 
inflation up to about 7% by January 2024, 
from 4% in December 2023 and 3.4% in 
November 2023.
Future Prospects
In terms of industry outlook, the Sri Lanka 
telecommunications market revenue is 
expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.8% over 
the next five years. Most of the major 
telecom companies in the world are 
present in the country, making significant 
R&D investments consistently. Key 
telecom operators have completed 5G 
demonstrations and trials. Customers will 
slowly migrate from 3G and 4G networks to 
the 5G network, once it is implemented.


The impending arrival of the 5th Generation 
of mobile networks heralds a connectivity 
revolution, poised to assume a more 
significant role than its predecessors. As 
per the Ministry of Telecommunication 
and Digital Infrastructure’s projections, 
the development of 5G technology alone 
has the potential to contribute up to 10% 
of Sri Lanka’s total GDP by 2025, and 
generate over one million jobs. It could 
augment Sri Lanka’s GDP from USD 8 Bn. to 
USD 20 Bn. by the year 2030.
The proposed merger between Dialog 
and Airtel would create a combined entity 
with a significant advantage in spectrum 
ownership. The combined holding would 
represent a higher portion of the total 
spectrum allocated in the mobile industry. 
Industry analysts point to spectrum 
ownership as a key factor determining 
product quality and overall competitiveness; 
indicating the merger could grant 
immediate subscriber growth and a 
potential service and network quality edge.
During the year, the Company achieved 
a significant milestone by introducing 
the innovative hybrid model (SA+NSA) 
technology of 5G for the first time in 
Sri Lanka. With the deployment of 5G 
Standalone, SLT is positioned to support 
essential applications requiring UltraReliable Low Latency Communication 
(URLLC) with enhanced latency, and 
enhance its capacity for Network Slicing, 
Robust Quality of Service (QoS) Assurance, 
Edge Computing, and various other cuttingedge functionalities.
Under the leadership of SLT, which 
straddles the fixed line and mobile spheres, 
and is fully geared to take the country 
towards the future, this could be the 
transformative scenario that awaits the 
telecommunications industry, as well as 
the Sri Lankan economy. The Company’s 
diverse technological and human resources 
could pave the way for a revolution in 
telecommunications, reaping vast soci
economic benefits for the nation.



Our strategic focus on operational excellence, digital 
transformation, and customer-centric solutions underscores 
our commitment to delivering value to our stakeholders and 
positioning SLT for long-term success




Materiality
“Materiality” refers to the significance and relevance of matters that 
substantively affect an organisation’s ability to create value over the 
short, medium and long-term.
Materiality extends beyond financial considerations to encompass 
various factors, including aspects such as Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG). Determination of materiality involves an 
assessment of the impact an issue has on the organisation’s ability 
to create and preserve value over time. This assessment considers 
both quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial 
metrics, operational impacts, and stakeholder interests, in order to 
provide a balanced and comprehensive view of the organisation’s 
performance, risks, and opportunities. 
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT) employs a meticulous and 
comprehensive approach in determining material issues, employing 
rigorous criteria integral to portraying an accurate depiction of 
the Company’s operational landscape. Financial significance is 
methodically assessed through quantitative metrics, encompassing 
revenue streams, cost structures, and capital allocation, ensuring a 
precise evaluation of monetary impact on SLT’s financial standing. 
Operational impact analysis delves into key performance indicators 
(KPIs), operational efficiencies, and technological infrastructure 
considerations to gauge the ramifications on day-to-day activities.
Relevance to stakeholders involves a sophisticated stakeholder 
mapping, integrating customer feedback, investor expectations, 
employee concerns, and compliance with regulatory bodies. 
Moreover, SLT incorporates a legal and regulatory compliance 
framework, tracking changes in telecommunications regulations, 
and aligning its reporting with industry standards




SLT demonstrates robust adherence to internationally recognised 
ESG standards and frameworks. Committed to sustainable 
practices, SLT aligns its operations with recognised ESG 
benchmarks, fostering transparency and accountability. Relevant 
trends are analysed through competitive intelligence, and 
sustainability metrics are embedded to align the report with ESG 
benchmarks. 
This determined and purposeful synthesis of technical inputs 
ensures that the annual report not only meets industry standards 
but also serves as a robust tool for stakeholders to make 
informed assessments of SLT’s performance in the dynamic 
telecommunications sector


Stakeholders
Stakeholders play a key role in sustaining and strengthening the ecosystem of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC. Maintaining a harmonious relationship 
with stakeholders enables the Company to stay responsive to market demands, regulatory changes, and technological advancements in the 
telecommunications industry. This collaborative synergy is essential for the sustained development and long-term success of the Company 
in the dynamic telecommunications landscape of the country. Stakeholders play a unique collaborative and supportive role in contributing 
towards the Company’s growth and success. 
SLT serves a diverse clientele, spanning individuals to sizable global enterprises. Specialised teams are assigned to oversee the requirements 
of these distinct segments, ensuring tailored responses to their specific needs




Finance
Financial and Economic 
Backdrop
The year under review was a challenging 
one for the telecommunication industry 
in general amidst a turbulent macroeconomic environment in the country. 
Adverse impacts of the financial and 
economic crisis lingering from 2022 
continued to be felt in 2023. With the 
steep depreciation of the Rupee in 2022 
and soaring inflation, the industry had to 
cope with an unprecedented rise in costs. 
Customers were also severely affected with 
their purchasing power being squeezed. 
The industry suffered a double whammy 
with reduced revenue and increased 
costs. Electricity is a major component of 
the industry’s cost base; electricity costs 
increased more than double in several 
rounds of tariff escalations starting from 
2H2022. Another significant cost element, 
viz. network /IP and IT infrastructure 
maintenance costs, also increased by 
around 80-100%, due to depreciation of the 
Rupee and inflation. In addition, transport 
costs also increased significantly. This is 
attributable to the 200 - 300% increase in 
fuel costs, and the increase in hiring costs 
caused by the import ban on vehicles. While 
these cost elements increased manyfold, revenues plummeted. Affordability 
of customers was severely affected by 
inflation on one hand and income tax rates 
doubling from 18% to 36% on the other. 
Telecommunication services, though 
important to customers, do not rank as high 
in their order of priorities as food, medicine 
or children’s education.
Consequently, the SLT Group reported a 
downturn in its results for the year under 
review, recording a marginal degrowth in 
revenue of 1.2% YoY to LKR 106.4 Bn. and 
a loss after tax for the year of LKR 3.9 Bn. 
The total assets of the Group increased by 
2.5% YoY to LKR 246.7 Bn. as at 
31 December 2023. 
Given below is a detailed analysis of how we 
nurtured our Financial Capital during the 
year under review, demonstrating resilience 
of the SLT Group to withstand challenging 
operating conditions.


#!--


Income Statement
Revenue
Group revenue decreased by 1.2% YoY 
to LKR 106.4 Bn. in 2023 from LKR 107.7 
Bn. in 2022. SLT company recorded a 
growth in revenue of 3.2% during the 
year primarily driven by growth in revenue 
from broadband, IPTV and expansion of 
enterprise and carrier domestic business. 
Full year impact of the tariff increase in the 
latter half of 2022 also made a positive 
contribution to revenue from broadband 
and IPTV services. Mobitel recorded a 
degrowth in revenue of 5.7% primarily due 
to decrease in the subscriber base resulting 
from increased subscriber churn and issues 
relating to affordability of subscribers.



Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, 
Depreciation and Amortisation 
(EBITDA)
Compounding impact of degrowth in 
Group revenue and increase in operating 
expenses, resulted in a drop in EBITDA by 
19.1% in 2023, compared to 2022. The 
SLT Group implemented several initiatives 
to manage escalating costs which led to 
a reduction in staff costs and advertising 
and activation costs along with repair and 
maintenance costs also decreasing during 
the latter part of the year. However, these 
savings were outweighed by the fall in the 
top line and an increase in other costs and 
depreciation, driving overall losses. As a 
result, EBITDA margin of the SLT Group 
decreased from 37.1% in 2022, to 30.4% 
in 2023.


Fixed operations of the Group recorded 
an EBITDA of LKR 23.6 Bn. reflecting a 
decrease of 1.8% YoY. EBITDA margin 
dropped marginally from 35.6% in 2022 to 
33.9% in 2023, driven by the increase in 
operating expenditure. EBITDA of mobile 
operations decreased by 47.7% to LKR 
8.8 Bn. causing the EBITDA margin to 
substantially reduce to 20.7% in 2023, from 
37.4% in 2022. This was due to the increase 
in electricity tariffs, impact of depreciation 
of the Rupee that increased expenses 
including annual maintenance costs and 
license fees, and repair and maintenance 
costs.


Managing Costs 
Several rounds of electricity tariff increases 
starting from second half of 2022 had 
a significant impact on the operating 
expenses. Transport costs too recorded 
a substantial increase as a result of 
increased fuel prices and import ban on 
vehicles. These factors negated the savings 
from cost containment initiatives taken 
during the year, resulting in the Group’s 
operating costs increasing by 7.5%. Direct 
costs increased by 8.8%, primarily due to

inflationary pressures, rising energy costs 
and increasing annual maintenance cost. 
The overall cost increase of 7.5% combined 
with the degrowth in revenue of 1.2%, 
caused operating profit to decline by 67.2%, 
and the operating profit margin to decline to 
3.9% in 2023, compared to 11.6% in 2022.
Cost Analysis


Profit Before and After Tax
The Group recorded a loss before tax 
of LKR 2.7 Bn. in 2023 compared to the 
profit of LKR 10.6 Bn. in 2022, a 125% 
decrease, due to the degrowth in revenue, 
the increase in operating expenses and the 
substantial increase in interest expense, 
which was partly offset by the foreign 
exchange gain compared to the foreign 
exchange loss in the previous year and the 
growth in other income. An income tax 
provision of LKR 1.3 Bn. for the year caused 
the loss after tax of the Group to increase 
to LKR 3.9 Bn. for the year compared 
to the profit after tax of LKR 4.8 Bn., a 
182.3% decrease. 
The Group’s fixed operations recorded a 
loss of LKR 1.1 Bn. in 2023 compared to the 
profit of LKR 8.5 Bn. in 2022 as a result of 
soaring interest expenses and escalating 
operating cost during the year. The Group’s 
mobile operations recorded a loss of 
LKR 3.7 Bn. mainly due to revenue degrowth 
and increased operating expenses.

Financial Position
SLT continued to make strategic 
investments in the continuation of the 
Fibre To The Home project, new global 
undersea cable SEA-ME-WE 6, and 
increase in bandwidth to enhance revenue 
generation capabilities. 


Non-current Assets
Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) 
accounts for the single largest component 
of the Group assets, amounting to 70.9% 
of Total Assets. The strategic investments 
referred to above caused the net book 
value of PPE of the Group to increase from 
LKR 164.9 Bn. as at 31 December 2022 to 
LKR 174.8 Bn. as at 31 December 2023. 
PPE and Right of Use Assets accounted 
for 91.9% of non-current assets as of the 
reporting date.


Current Assets
Trade and other receivables, which accounts 
for the largest component of current 
assets remained approximately around the 
same level of 2022 in absolute terms, but 
increased from 58.7% in 2022 to 63.7% 
in 2023 in proportion to total current 
assets due to a decrease in the latter from 
LKR 55.5 Bn. to LKR 50.3 Bn. during the year.
The Group’s liquidity position in terms of 
short-term investments and cash and cash 
equivalents decreased to LKR 12.5 Bn. as 
at 31 December 2023 reflecting a decline 
of 31.1% compared to LKR 18.1 Bn. as at 
December 31, 2022. This was due to the 
utilisation of a portion of the liquid assets 
for funding strategic projects such as 
SEA-ME-WE 6 and FTTH. Other current 
assets amounted to 11.5% of the total 
current assets which included LKR 4.1 Bn. 
worth of inventories

Capital and Funding
Consequent to the loss incurred during 
the year, equity amounted to LKR 88.6 Bn. 
as at the end of the 2023 compared to 
LKR 92.5 Bn as at the end of the 2022 and 
accounted for 35.9% of all funding sources 
compared to 38.4% in 2022. As a result, 
shortfall in funding for the growth in PPE 
and intangible assets over and above the 
amounts drawn down from short-term 
investments and cash and cash equivalents 
as detailed above, had to be secured 
from borrowings and vendor financing. 
Accordingly, total borrowings of the Group 
increased by 34.9% from LKR 47.3 Bn. as at 
31 December 2022 to LKR 63.8 Bn. as at 
31 December 2023. Trade payables 
decreased by 16.0% to LKR 43.9 Bn. as 
at 31 December 2023. Other current and 
non-current liabilities amounted to 19.2% 
of total funding and included lease liabilities 
of LKR 6.2 Bn. and employee benefits of 
LKR 6.1 Bn. amongst others.



Cashflows
The net cash flows generated from 
operations decreased by 40.4% to 
LKR 17.2 Bn. The main contributory factors 
for the decrease were the substantial 
increase in interest payments due to 
increase in interest rates, the amount 
of new borrowings and a decrease in 
trade and other payables. The cash 
outflow on investing activities amounted 
to LKR 32.7 Bn. in 2023 compared to 
LKR 40.8 Bn. in 2022 due to prioritising of 
capital expenditure (capex) in high yielding, 
short payback period investments such as 
fibre project to improve revenue. Despite 
the increasing gearing levels, it is imperative 
that the Group continues to invest in new 
technologies and capacity enhancements 
to support the Nation’s increased 
dependency on telecommunication and 
digital products in every aspect of life. Net


cash generated from financing activities 
recorded a substantial increase and 
amounted to LKR 13.1 Bn. comprising of 
borrowings from financial institutions of 
LKR 28.2 Bn. which was partly offset by an 
increase in loan repayments by LKR 5.4 Bn. 
during the year. 
Although there is a reduction during 
the year, the Group concluded the 
financial year with a favourable net 
cash and cash equivalents balance of 
LKR 5.1 Bn. compared to LKR 8.6 Bn. a year 
ago. Prudent management of financial 
resources and forex exposure helped 
the Group to record these results. The 
Group has sufficient liquid assets to meet 
its obligations and is poised for growth 
with enhanced value propositions for its 
stakeholders.


Value to Investors
Investors have received sustained earnings 
growth from the SLT Group supported 
by the strength of its unified brand, 
market position, continued investments 
in cutting-edge technology, and capacity 
enhancements. Strong governance and a 
socially and environmentally responsible 
mindset have supported the Company’s 
growth with the prudent balancing of 
stakeholder interests. The graphs below 
provide a summary of the value delivered to 
its investors.



Looking to the Future
Given the need to invest in infrastructure on one hand and increasing level of gearing on 
the other, it is imperative that the Company exercises care and prioritise carefully when 
making capex investments, limiting it to essential enhancements. We intend to continue to 
concentrate on high return short-payback period investments. Some capex investments 
that are less urgent may have to be deferred to 2025 and 2026. A focus area will be the 
expansion of the fibre network, which will lead to increased revenues. Expansion of wireless 
will be a priority for Mobitel. Given the cost optimisation measures already implemented, 
large cost increases are not anticipated in 2024. Accordingly, we look forward to restore 
profitability in 2024, which will enable us to reward our stakeholders with substantial 
increments. We also plan to introduce new packages that will add value to our customers, 
which will enhance our profitability. 



Our Infrastructure
SLT’s success relies on a robust foundation: 
its physical infrastructure. This includes an 
expansive communications network across 
the island; cutting edge data centres that 
are a complex nexus of physical and digital 
infrastructure; a diverse range of equipment 
and devices; and physical buildings such 
as offices, maintenance centres, training 
and experience centres, teleshops and 
other customer touch points. These assets 
are essential to the functioning of the 
telecommunications value-chain, and for 
delivering SLT’s industry-leading offering to 
a wide customer base including domestic, 
enterprise, and wholesale customers

#!--

Our assets and infrastructure stand out 
for their quality with a focus on reliability 
and performance. We ensure diligent 
partnerships, procurement, and sourcing 
from leading local and international 
brands to create a sturdy base for efficient 
service delivery. 
SLT’s infrastructural resources are 
strategically deployed to meet national and 
business goals aligned with the imperative 
to expand access to digital services 
across the Country. Our investments and 

infrastructure expansion benefit Sri Lanka’s 
development, strengthen the value-chain, 
and serve our customers to improve their 
digital lifestyle needs. They also foster 
economic growth, improve educational 
opportunities, and contribute to societal 
development as a whole; positioning 
SLT as a key driver in Sri Lanka’s digital 
transformation journey.

To meet growing demand in an increasingly 
digitalised world, we are constantly 
investing in expanding, maintaining, and 
better managing our critical infrastructure. 
Our Network Operations and Facilities 
Management Divisions play a key role. 
While managing the comprehensive 
network operations of the Group, these 
divisions also spearhead new initiatives, 
pilot projects, ongoing network planning 
and maintenance, and customer 
service fulfilment.
Consolidation of our operations and 
services has enabled SLT to optimise 
day-to-day maintenance, investments, 
and deployments leading to considerable 
cost and time savings. Continuous 
capability development of our teams and 
introduction of performance indicators and 
incentives have further improved efficiency 
of our infrastructure management and 
maintenance.
During the year 2023, our infrastructure 
investments focused on expansion of 
the network, consolidation of the Group’s 
operational footprint, and investing in key 
projects that would enhance Sri Lanka’s 
global connectivity and create new avenues 
for advancement of digitalisation ambitions.
Fuelled by the surge in mobile broadband 
usage, which took off during the pandemic, 
and is intensified by Sri Lanka’s ongoing 
digital transformation; Mobitel prioritised its 
wireless network expansion for broadband 
throughout 2023. Mobitel invested over 
LKR 13.4 billion during the year for wireless 
network expansion.
This addressed the growing demand for 
high-speed data and focused on enhancing 
customer experience. Network upgrades 
over 530 sites significantly enhanced 
4G capacity, resulting in a 40% traffic 
increase during the year. Further, Mobitel 
deployed over 180 new 4G sites across 
the island, extending broadband access to 
previously underserved areas and fostering 
a “connected life” for all Sri Lankans. 
Strategic expansion and investment in 
the high-bandwidth 2.6GHz 4G network 
footprint, by adding 400 new sites, also 
allowed for delivery of superior connectivity 
to customers.


Physical Presence and Reach
SLT’s footprint across the island includes 
an array of touchpoints that ensure 
customers have access to prompt and 
efficient services. As the national carrier 
tasked with ensuring digital access and 
connectivity, our efforts seek to bridge the 
gap between essential physical presence 
and customer-centric reach that empowers 
our customers and communities.


In 2023, we proudly unveiled 
SLT’s new state-of-the-art 
Operational Headquarters in 
Welikada, Colombo. Stage I of the 
project delivered a five floors of 
the 9-storey building, constructed 
with a clear focus and commitment 
to sustainability. Designed with 
several green features and inclusion 
of cutting-edge technology, this 
operational headquarters is expected 
to result in significant long-term cost 
savings for the Group


Network Infrastructure
Our installed network infrastructure comprises a total core network, extensive transport 
and access network, international network, and a control network that includes 
switching facilities. 
The section on Driving a Smarter Sri Lanka (page 7), details the extent and expansion of 
our National Backbone Network (NBN), and SLT’s consortium partnerships for international 
submarine cable infrastructure that connects Sri Lanka to the rest of the world


Further, SLT and Mobitel maintain over 
4500 wireless network locations island 
wide offering mobile and Fixed Wireless 
Access (FWA) services to customers. Both 
companies are planning for a common 
wireless network deployment supporting 
both mobile and FWA services, to improve 
network efficiencies, asset utilisation 
and reduce costs. Furthermore, 5G trial 
network is deployed in 5 cities in the country 
using trial licenses issued by TRCSL for 
customers to experience 5G services. 
Customers with SLT or Mobitel connections 
and 5G-compatible devices can visit 5G trial 
zones to experience this new service.
Prepaid service was launched during the 
year for SLT 4G Home broadband users, 
which will give more flexibility, and more 
product offerings to customers.
We are planning to introduce enhancements 
to our network infrastructure by 
implementation of the Network Functions 
Virtualisation Infrastructure (NFVI) platform. 
With partial implementation now in place, 
we are significantly more prepared to 
introduce new services, offer on-demand 
capacity as needed, enhance flexibility 
and customisation options, and elevate 
the overall customer experience. Making 
improvements to our critical backbone – the 
transport network, we have undertaken 
efforts to upgrade the network through a 
software-defined, cloud-based solution 
that would enable automatic route 
optimisation amongst other benefits.
Data Centre Infrastructure
As Sri Lanka’s economy undergoes digital 
transformation and advances in digital 
and communications infrastructure, the 
demand for data storage, processing, cloud 
computing, and virtualisation is on the rise. 
This growth is fuelled by developments 
in Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence 
(AI), Hyperscalers, and the emergence of 
cloud computing: leading to an increased 
need for data centers. In response to these 
trends, SLT has made a strategic decision to 
expand its data center infrastructure. Our 
investments in data centers play a crucial 
role in Sri Lanka’s journey towards fostering 
digitally-enabled enterprises and nurturing 
the service-export sector


SLT currently operates five data centers, 
with our Tier III data center in Pitipana 
being purpose-built to meet the highest 
global standards for uptime, security, and 
environmental responsibility. This facility 
holds certifications such as Uptime Tier 
Certification, Green Gold certification, ISO 
27001, and ISO 9001. Our Data Centre 
Networks are designed based on Software 
Defined Network (SDN) architectures 
and are equipped with cutting-edge 
technologies. Interconnected with 
high-speed links, our data centers are 
engineered to offer advanced Disaster 
Avoidance (DA) and Disaster Recovery 
(DR) solutions. These facilities consistently 
maintain high availability ratings that align 
with global standards.

Furthermore, SLT’s data center 
infrastructure boasts the largest rack 
space in the country and seamless global 
integration through international undersea 
cables. This strategic focus on expanding 
and enhancing our data center capabilities 
underscores our commitment to providing 
secure, reliable, and efficient data storage 
and processing solutions to support the 
evolving digital landscape in Sri Lanka.
In 2023, we increased capacity at our 
Colombo data centre enhanced network 
performance by boosting the Multiprotocol 
Label Switching (MPLS) network within data 
centres to 200 gigabytes; and streamlined 
operations by implementing upgrades to 
software-defined network architecture.


Protecting our Networks from Cyber Threats and Data Breaches
To protect our network infrastructure and safeguard critical information against 
cyber threats and potential data breaches, we have implemented a comprehensive set 
of security protocols that adhere to the rigorous guidelines of ISO 27001 (Information 
Security Management System), complemented by a Business Continuity Management 
System in line with ISO 22301 standards.
Our robust security strategy is based on a defense-in-depth framework and a 
zero-trust model, ensuring comprehensive protection across all networks, systems, 
and platforms. This is achieved through the deployment of advanced industry level 
security tools and the enforcement of well-defined internal policies and operational 
procedures.
Next Generation Firewalls, strategically positioned at our data centers, serve as the 
first defense against unauthorised access or any malicious traffic. To further secure 
sensitive data and ensure operational platforms remain accessible only to verified 
individuals, we have implemented a Privileged Access Management (PAM) system, 
which incorporates two-factor authentication and is supported by strict physical 
access controls. Additionally, we have implemented Endpoint Detection and Response 
(EDR) to safeguard our endpoints and servers. A Network Detection and Response 
(NDR) system has also been implemented to efficiently detect any anomalies in 
network traffic.
Our commitment to cybersecurity is strengthened by SLT’s 24/7 Next-Gen 
Cybersecurity Operations Center, which is equipped with a sophisticated Security 
Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. This facility offers enhanced 
detection and monitoring capabilities, enabling us to rapidly identify and respond to 
security incidents in real time across all operational domains. 
Additionally, our Business Continuity Management system defines clear protocols 
for responding to cyberattacks, aiming to minimise impact and ensure the continuation 
of operations, guided by the expertise of our Cyber Security Incident Response Team 
(CSIRT)

Looking to 
the Future
• For 2024, the Group has earmarked 
significant resources for energy 
management initiatives. The focus 
is on implementing solar power 
systems and exploring the potential 
of wind energy in Sri Lanka’s 
Northern and Eastern regions. This 
two-pronged approach aims to 
reduce the environmental footprint of 
our operations while securing reliable, 
renewable energy sources for the 
future.
• Having piloted 5G technology in five 
of Sri Lanka’s largest cities, we will 
continue to implement 5G projects 
and initiatives with the launch of 
commercial 5G services. 
• From the perspective of security, we 
are looking to gradually transition 
some of our infrastructure to 
unmanned stations by leveraging 
CCTV and AI-driven solutions.
• Expanding our Fibre-to-the-Home 
(FTTH) network and 4G network, 
we have planned to provide superior 
service to our customers through 
wired and wireless technology. 
This network expansion will also 
cater to the requirements of other 
telecommunication operators and the 
wholesale and enterprise segments.
• Building on the demonstrated success 
of our ongoing Proof of Concept 
(POC) project, we are exploring a 
transition to a Network Function 
Virtualised (NFV) environment that 
would simplify management, improve 
reliability, and deliver significant 
operational efficiency gains.
• Working to ensure seamless access 
and lower latency between our data 
centres, we are prioritising high-speed 
links with a capacity of 100 GBps. This 
focus directly addresses customer 
preferences for faster and more 
reliable services. In addition, preparing 
for potential demand increase, we are 
pursuing partnerships to expand SLT’s 
data centre in Pitipana. Upcoming 
completion of the SEA-ME-WE 6 
submarine cable, coupled with SLT’s 
existing landing station infrastructure 
in Colombo, Mt Lavinia, and Matara; 
promises new opportunities to attract 
international hyperscalers while 
routing traffic to our data centres and 
networks.

Intellectual Resources
Brand Unification and 
Brand Building 
The integration of SLT and Mobitel 
operations leading to organisational 
alignment and the rebranding of the 
unified entity as “SLT- MOBITEL”, has been 
strengthened by combining the positive 
reputation of both entities into a single, 
strong brand focused on digitalisation. This 
was a process which commenced in 2021, 
and has now reached fruition. This has been 
a journey and a learning process the full 
benefits of which were reaped in 2023.
From an organisational standpoint, the 
merger has led to vastly improved financial 
resources, operational efficiencies, cost 
reductions, and enhanced investments in 
infrastructure and innovation. Despite many 
challenges stemming from the operating 
environment, SLT-MOBITEL has maintained 
its Brand Equity Index – Fixed broadband 
in the 70+ range. The Brand Equity 
Index – Fixed line has held its position as the 
leader in this category.
This has delivered significant benefits 
including convenience and cost savings 
for individual consumers through bundled 
service offerings and streamlined billing 
processes. They can now enjoy innovative 
products and services incorporating the 
latest technologies, improved service 
quality, expanded coverage, and enhanced 
brand experience, resulting in increased 
satisfaction and loyalty. Corporate and SME 
customers now benefit from integrated 
communication solutions, fostering 
efficiency and productivity. 
Towards becoming 
a Tech Company
With a broader service portfolio and 
enhanced capabilities, we are now better 
positioned to innovate, invest in advanced 
technologies, and compete effectively in 
the dynamic telecommunications market, 
ultimately delivering greater value to 
customers and stakeholders. Following 
this successful unification, we have begun 
gradually transitioning from Telco towards 
more techco-oriented solutions to meet 
the demands of all stakeholders. 


Telecommunication companies now face 
competition from tech giants such as 
Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), 
and Facebook, media conglomerates, and 
start-ups, compelling them to redefine their 
roles in the market. This journey from Telco 
to Techco involves embracing personalised 
services, digitalisation, innovation, 
and diversification, all underpinned by 
seamless connectivity. The journey from 
Telco to Techco is not a mere change of 
services; it is a strategic imperative for 
telecommunications companies to ensure 
their survival and thrive in the digital era. 
This transformative path offers multiple 
benefits: including a robust competitive 
edge and diversified revenue streams. SLT’s 
Digital Transformation programme takes a 
structured approach to achieve the Techco 
transformation within the company.
One of the key strengths of SLT lies in 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for which we have 
embarked on projects where we deployed 
Extract Transform and Load (ETL) to extract 
information from multiple data sources. 
The completion of this project in November 
2023 signifies a significant milestone in 
enhancing data management capabilities. 
In addition, we are in the process of 
upgrading one of the key projects of SLT, 
a billing consolidation project. This would 
upgrade the existing systems of retail billing, 
interconnect billing and the mediation 
system to the latest version.
Operating Licence
In a highly competitive, albeit highly 
regulated, industry SLT continued to be 
in the forefront as the licensed National 
Information and Communications 
Technology solutions provider of 
Sri Lanka. SLT obtained the license 
from Telecommunications Regulatory 
Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL), which 
was renewed in 2023. With the unification 
of the two companies unified licensing 
is expected on finalising of the process 
by TRCSL. The financial statements give 
the value of the operating licenses as 
LKR 1.6 Bn. and LKR 1.44 Bn. for SLT and 
Mobitel respectively. However, the intrinsic 
relative value of the two licenses is much 
more heavily weighted towards SLT Group. 


Licenses held by the SLT Group;
• Fixed Operator License issued by TRCSL
• Mobile Operator License issued by 
TRCSL
• Broadcasting License to provide Internet 
Protocol Television (IPTV) service issued 
by Ministry of Mass Media
• Direct to Home (DTH) Satellite 
Broadcasting License issued by TRCSL
• Satellite Television Broadcasting License 
issued by Ministry of Mass Media
• License for Spectrum issued by TRCSL
• Vendor License issued by TRCSL
Spearheading Innovation
We have innovatively developed numerous 
IoT applications. These applications are 
actively marketed to customers through the 
enterprise route. Additionally, our portfolio 
includes the successful delivery of a 
call-centre solution, a queue management 
solution, and workflow solutions. Notably, 
our call centre solution is currently 
operational at prominent organisations 
such as the Ceylon Electricity Board, 
National Water Supplies and Drainage 
Board, and the Sri Lanka Insurance 
Corporation Limited.
We have identified specific processes 
for simplification and modernisation, as 
part of a Group-wide initiative to enhance 
operational efficiency. Notably, our 
strides in digitalisation have propelled us 
to a paperless operation, surpassing the 
75% mark. This encompasses the digital 
management of documents through 
our Document Management System 
(DMS) and the handling of Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) digitally. These 
advancements mark a significant transition 
towards streamlined and contemporary 
operational practices.
In a landmark event, SLT has launched 
its long-awaited VMWare Double Cloud 
Service, VCL. This is an innovative step 
that has made SLT a key player in the cloud 
revolution. This introduces a dual cloud 
architecture that leverages the features of 
two cloud environments.

 Consolidation of 
Data Centres 
In response to the increased costs 
stemming from currency devaluation, 
we are implementing measures to reduce 
overall expenses. One significant step 
involves consolidating the data resources 
of SLT and Mobitel in the data centre. 
This strategic move aims to minimise our 
footprint and concurrently achieve cost 
reductions.
Measuring Our Digital 
Maturity
We carried out a comprehensive analysis 
of the current status (AS-IS Study) of 
our Company based on the TMForum’s 
(Tele-Management Forum) Digital Maturity 
Model (DMM) to ascertain the current digital 
maturity level of the Organisation. This 
study was done assessing the organisation 
under six main dimensions – Customer, 
Strategy, Technology, Operations,


Data and People and Culture based 
on the sub-dimensions and criteria 
setforth by TMForum’s DMM model. 
Additionally, we ascertained the required 
internal advancements through distinct 
sub-programmes and projects tied to digital 
transformation activities. 
Measuring outcomes in both quantitative 
and qualitative terms allows us to track 
progress, ensuring alignment with 
targets at various timeframes. This 
systematic approach, rooted in the TM 
Forum framework, provides a structured 
method for evaluating our digital 
transformation success and fostering 
continuous improvement. The blueprint for 
implementation has been finalised, and we 
will be taking the measures required to put it 
into action.
Further, we have established a digital 
transformation core team and Steering 
Committee headed by the CEO and 
respective Chief Officers from SLT and


Mobitel. We have also established six 
centre of excellence teams, with the aim of 
providing expertise and guidance to improve 
digital maturity across the six dimensions.
The Roadmap for Progress
Based on the current maturity level scores 
assessed in the AS-IS study, we derived a 
target Digital Maturity Score, that aligns with 
our Strategic Objectives of Transforming 
SLT and Mobitel from Telco to Techco. In 
order to achieve these strategic objectives, 
we developed our Strategic Blue print 
formulating five sub-programmes under 
our DT programme.
30 Projects were defined under the 
5 sub-programmes to drive our Digital 
Transformation Journey. This transition 
and greater digital maturity would increase 
our competitiveness, enable SLT and 
Mobitel to be more responsive to market 
needs, while maximising on opportunities 
stemming from Sri Lanka’s digital economy

Successful implementation of these 
projects and achievement of connected 
KPIs would help the Group achieve our 
overarching business goals. 
In a fast-moving and technologically 
evolving industry our human resources 
need to be honed to meet not only the 
challenges that are present, but those that 
are to come. Our staff needs to be trained 
not only on technological aspects but also 
on market and business aspects. We also 
need to recruit, retain, and nurture the best 
talent. The numerous awards we have won 
(refer pages 46 and 47), are a tribute to our 
diverse strengths and achievements. 
Benefits of Digital 
Transformation for 
Customers
With the envisaged digital transformation, 
customers can look forward to vastly 
improved service delivery, as we are 
expanding our offerings in various ways. 
Access to our services can be facilitated 
through digital channels like the MySLT app, 
Selfcare portal and ChatBot etc. An example 
is the online PDH portal, allowing customers 
to log in and verify the availability of a 
fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) connection. If 
accessible, customers can make payments 
and proceed with the connection. This 
portal is undergoing enhancements to 
accommodate our upcoming 180,000 new 
connection programme scheduled for next 
year, ensuring a streamlined and efficient 
process for users.

Environment
The Environment, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) strategy of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC 
(SLT) is built upon three fundamental pillars: 
nature, education, and health, all of which 
are closely aligned with the 17 United 
Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 
(UN SDGs). Our ESG policies are woven 
around these internationally recognised 
goals, ensuring a holistic approach to 
environmental and social sustainability, 
as well as responsible governance and 
business practices. Under the Environment 
pillar of the ESG strategy, we have 
established three distinct sub-pillars: energy 
management, waste management, and 
environmental preservation. Oversight of 
progress in these key areas is carried out 
by dedicated cross-functional committees 
comprising Senior Management personnel. 
Management Approach
SLT has adopted a comprehensive 
management approach to ensure 
environmental sustainability across all 
operations, personnel, and relationships, by 
integrating environmental considerations 
into strategic planning and decision-making 
processes and setting clear goals and

targets for sustainability. The Company has 
invested in technology and infrastructure 
to reduce its carbon footprint and minimise 
environmental impact. 
The Company also educates and 
empowers its personnel through training 
and awareness programmes, fostering 
a culture of environmental responsibility 
throughout the Organisation. Additionally, 
SLT collaborates with suppliers, partners, 
and stakeholders to promote sustainable 
practices across the entire supply chain. 
By prioritising environmental sustainability 
at every level, SLT has consistently 
demonstrated its commitment to 
protecting the environment while delivering 
telecommunications services responsibly 
and ethically.
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC aims to adopt the 
ISO 50001:2018 standard to align with 
the nation’s energy management policy. 
Additionally, we anticipate attaining ISO 
14001 Environmental Management System 
Certification by Q2 2024.
The Company prioritises adoption of 
renewable energy sources and implements 
energy-efficient technologies to minimise 

energy consumption and carbon emissions. 
Waste management initiatives include 
reducing waste generation, implementing 
recycling programmes, and ensuring proper 
disposal methods to mitigate environmental 
impact. Environmental preservation 
efforts include conserving natural habitats, 
biodiversity, and ecosystems, and actively 
participating in reforestation efforts.
Energy Policy
SLT is committed to providing the best 
possible communication and entertainment 
services to its customers and ensuring 
its employees have a conducive working 
environment while at the same time fulfilling 
its corporate social responsibilities. 
To align with the above goals SLT is 
committed to using ISO 50001:2018 
as a guiding framework for its energy 
management system SLT is committed to 
using energy in the most efficient, costeffective, and environmentally responsible 
manner. The Company is thus meshing 
its own financial goals with its social 
responsibility.


We will continually improve our energy 
management by:
• Educating employees to increase their 
environmental consciousness
• Managing energy consumption and 
carbon emissions responsibly, especially 
by adopting energy efficient technologies 
and selecting the most environmentallyfriendly sources of energy where possible
• Making efficient energy management 
a consideration in all decision-making 
processes
• Reviewing energy policy objectives 
and targets periodically and increasing 
awareness among stakeholders
• Conducting energy audits and taking 
timely and effective corrective action 
• Educating business partners and drawing 
them into contributing to effective 
energy usage
• Inculcating awareness of the importance 
of energy conservation among SLTemployee-families so that it will become 
a lifestyle choice
• Expanding energy management culture 
to SLT subsidiaries.
This policy is applicable to all SLT business 
units and their employees.
Energy Management
The management of energy usage is 
monitored by cross-functional committees. 
Most of SLT’s energy consumption comes 
from network operations and not from the 
EUI of their buildings, which are designed 
with energy-efficient features such as 
solar panels, natural lighting, and insulation 
to reduce electricity consumption and 
carbon emissions. By prioritising sustainable 
infrastructure, SLT not only lowers 
operational costs but also minimises its 
environmental impact. 
Going beyond token initiatives in 
conservation, SLT has consistently 
demonstrated its commitment to the 
environment and natural resources through 
a number of initiatives. The Company has 
invested in eco-friendly technologies to 
reduce its carbon footprint, using energy

efficient infrastructure and renewable 
energy sources, including energy-efficient 
lighting and air conditioning.
Installing solar panels to generate power 
is a significant step forward, especially 
considering our high energy consumption, 
and reliance on the national electricity grid 
to meet our needs. Expanding this initiative 
across our island-wide infrastructure will 
enhance our energy self-reliance, reduce 
energy costs which are currently very high, 
and bolster our environmental credentials 
to a considerable extent. Energy usage 
has been minimised by energy efficient 
equipment such as efficient air conditioners, 
lamps, switch mode rectifiers and inverters. 
Implementation of LED bulbs has resulted 
in savings of around 600MWh annually. 
SLT introduced energy-efficient inverter 
type air conditioners resulting in an energy 
saving of around 550MWh. Reduction of 
energy consumption during the year 2023 
is 10% compared to 2022. Solar systems 
were installed at 19 sites up to 2023 and 
30 sites are planned for 2024 under OPEX 
model without capital expenditure. Further 
approval was granted to install solar panels 
in 201 sites which will have an energy saving 
of around 10%. 
Expenditure on grid-based energy 
comprises a significant aspect of SLT’s 
cost structure, while also exposing it to the 
vagaries of the seasonality of hydro-power, 
in addition to frequent power outages. 
Mobitel Initiatives
The past two years have seen a dramatic 
rise in annual network energy costs, with 
costs escalating by 135%, when compared 
to 2021. This surge is primarily driven by 
large increases in electricity and fuel tariffs. 
Resulting in energy becoming the single 
largest cost factor within our network 
operations. To address this challenge 
and ensure business resilience, we are 
prioritising the deployment of renewable 
energy solutions. This strategic shift aims 
to reduce dependence on commercially 
purchased power and fossil fuels; leading to 
significant reductions in cost and emissions, 
which in turn would contribute to the 
sustainability of our operations


o address rising energy costs and reduce 
our overall environmental footprint, 
Mobitel continues to develop renewable 
energy capacity. Phase 1 of a solar power 
deployment initiative successfully equipped 
300 network sites with solar solutions, 
adding 1748kW of renewable energy 
capacity. This translates to 3% of our total 
network energy needs now being met from 
clean and renewable energy sources. The 
transition to renewable energy sources is a 
crucial step towards reducing SLT’s carbon 
emissions and achieving our long-term 
goal of net-zero by 2050. Coincidentally, 
this shift has also contributed to increased 
network availability, as addition of alternative 
power sources has enhanced network 
resilience during power outages, driving 
progress towards a more self-sustainable 
network. 
Energy Efficiency Measures
Minimising energy wastage such as 
prevention of air-conditioning leakages, 
shutting down idle equipment, replacement 
of inefficient equipment, load shifting, 
turning off equipment (computers, lamps, 
air-conditioners etc.) when not in use, are 
the main energy saving measures taken 
during the year. In addition, consolidation 
of equipment and power systems to form 
common equipment rooms to utilise energy 
efficiently and effectively. 
Energy week was conducted throughout 
the Company to raise awareness amongst 
staff while providing hands-on experience 
for network teams. Throughout Energy 
Week, we held daily quiz programmes and 
an art competition for employees’ children. 
Winners were awarded prizes to encourage 
participation in energy-saving activities.
Progress in Carbon Neutrality
Since obtaining its initial Carbon 
Assessment ISO Standard in 2018, SLT 
has consistently tracked emissions, 
implemented eco-friendly practices, and 
strived to diminish its carbon footprint. 
The Company is following a clearly-defined 
strategy and roadmap towards achieving 
carbon-neutrality by 2040, which is ahead of 
the national goal of 2050.


Waste Management Strategies
A comprehensive waste management 
policy, practices and conservation 
initiatives form an important aspect of 
SLT’s commitment to environmental 
sustainability. Implementing waste 
management strategies, including recycling 
programmes and responsible, eco-friendly 
disposal methods, forms a crucial part 
of our environmental stewardship. Given 
our use of high-tech products with a high 
e-waste component, we have adopted 
a number of measures towards their 
responsible disposal, adhering to relevant 
environmental regulations and standards 
set forth by the Government, as well as 
international norms. 
Our recycling initiatives for e-waste 
materials consists of their segregation 
and processing for reuse or proper 
disposal. SLT promotes the reuse and 
refurbishment of electronic devices that 
are still functional or repairable and has 
established programmes for collecting, 
refurbishing, and redistributing used 
electronics to extend their lifespan and 
reduce the demand for new products. 
SLT promotes awareness among its 
employees and stakeholders regarding the 
importance of e-waste management and 
encourages them to participate in recycling 
programmes. Moreover, the Company 
collaborates with certified e-waste 
management partners who specialise in the 
proper handling and disposal of electronic 
waste to ensure that electronics are 
recycled in an environmentally responsible 
manner, with components separated and 
recycled or properly disposed of according 
to regulations. To safeguard sensitive 
information, SLT prioritises secure data 
wiping or destruction procedures when 
disposing of electronic devices. This 
ensures all personal or confidential data is 
completely removed before disposal.
SLT strives to reduce, reuse, and recycle 
paper waste, food waste, and e-waste 
across all operations, contributing towards 
a circular economy. This is an economic 
model that aims to minimise waste and 
maximise resource efficiency by keeping 
products, materials, and resources in use for 
as long as possible

The Company reduces paper waste by 
promoting digitalisation, encouraging 
electronic communication and 
documentation, in addition to paper 
recycling programme, reduction in food 
waste is ensured by segregation of 
such material. E-waste is minimised by 
implementing sustainable procurement 
practices, choosing durable and upgradable 
equipment, and extending the lifespan 
of electronic devices through proper 
maintenance. Functional electronic 
equipment, including end-of-life equipment 
and equipment from clients’ premises, are 
refurbished and redeployed giving them 
a second life.
Our waste reduction and waste disposal 
processes have been certified by Central 
Environmental Authority. We have 
established our own copper recycling plant 
to facilitate the recycling of copper cables 
which can be sold to suppliers for their 
material value. During 2023, 26,500 Kgs 
of copper was recovered in the recycling 
process. Such recycling helps conserve 
the cost of mining and produced new 
copper, while generating employment 
opportunities. The disposal of materials and 
equipment along the same lines is carried 
out by Mobitel as well. 
ISO 14001: Environmental 
Management System Certification 
ISO 14001 is an internationally recognised 
standard for environmental management 
systems (EMS) that helps organisations 
establish and implement an effective 
approach to managing their environmental 
responsibilities. SLT is in the process of 
obtaining ISO 14001 by Q2 2024.
The primary goal of ISO 14001 is to help 
organisations improve their environmental 
performance by identifying and managing 
their environmental aspects and impacts 
more effectively. This can lead to reduced 
resource consumption, waste generation, 
and emissions.
To ensure all operational and administrative 
activities comply with ISO 14001:2015 
requirements, SLT has established, 
documented, and implemented a robust 
Environmental Management System (EMS) 
with specific objectives. 

By establishing a system of processes, 
strategies, and procedures that direct 
performance toward environmental 
objectives and targets, the EMS is intended 
to help SLT address both compliance 
and environmental imperatives. The ISO 
14001:2015 standard places a strong 
emphasis on system performance 
improvement, and it is anticipated that 
SLT’s environmental performance will 
increase as a result. SLT believes that 
sound environmental management is a 
key component of its overall management 
responsibility.
The EMS applies to all operations including 
purchasing, designing and construction of 
new buildings and renovations, marketing, 
sales, waste disposal, and all other 
administrative functions.
In Sri Lanka’s telecommunications sector, 
ISO 14001 certification could provide a 
competitive edge. Customers who prioritise 
environmentally responsible companies 
might be more inclined to choose Sri Lanka 
Telecom over competitors without such 
certification.
“SLT-MOBITEL Operational HQ 
Building – Welikada” was awarded 
Platinum rating at the 12th 
Annual Green Building Awards 
Ceremony 2023

vegetation within the facade of the building 
is contained in troughs and completely 
irrigated using treated wastewater through 
an efficient drip irrigation system.
Preservation of 
the Ecosystem 
In order to reverse the alarming trend of 
environmental degradation and habitatloss, SLT is actively engaged in tree planting 
and conservation projects to preserve 
biodiversity and restore ecosystems in 
selected areas across the country. By 
participating in reforestation efforts and 
supporting habitat conservation initiatives, 
these efforts not only contribute to 
environmental preservation, but also help 
offset the Company’s ecological footprint, 
fostering a more balanced relationship 
between business operations and the 
natural environment.
The ecosystem preservation initiative 
of SLT has been focused mainly on the 
tree planting programme, carried out 
in collaboration with corporates, NGOs, 
government organisations and local 
communities. We strongly believe that

ree planting is crucial for environmental 
health, combatting soil erosion, and offering 
habitat for wildlife. Planting trees also 
enhances air quality, beautifies landscapes, 
and contributes to human well-being. 
These initiatives enhance the environment 
through improved forestation, fostering 
natural carbon sequestering, aiding 
greenhouse gas reduction, and promoting 
biodiversity. Additionally, they raise 
awareness of environmental conservation 
among nearby communities, fostering 
a deeper understanding of ecological 
stewardship. To date, the Company has 
planted 2,000 trees Island-wide.
Engaging with Stakeholders
SLT recognises the importance of 
environmental education and awareness 
in fostering a culture of sustainability. 
Through various campaigns, workshops, 
and partnerships with environmental 
organisations, the Company promotes 
environmental consciousness among 
its employees, customers, and the wider 
community. Raising awareness about 
environmental issues and advocating 
for sustainable practices enables SLT to 
empower stakeholders to make informed 
decisions, and take collective action 
towards environmental protection.
Sri Lanka Telecom collaborates across 
its entire supply chain to achieve 
environmental sustainability by 
implementing the iSupplier online platform, 
carrying out various initiatives and fostering 
partnerships with suppliers, vendors, and 
other stakeholders. This includes sourcing 
materials and products from reputed 
international suppliers who demonstrate 
commitment to sustainable practices 
and environmental responsibility. Raising 
awareness about environmental issues 
and best practices for sustainability among 
supply chain partners helps ensure that 
everyone understands their role in achieving 
environmental goals.

Driving Sustainability 
Among Employees
SLT drives sustainability among employees 
through comprehensive initiatives 
encompassing education, training on 
sustainable practices, energy efficiency, 
and waste reduction. SLT fosters a culture 
of sustainability by integrating green 
principles into everyday operations, from 
energy-efficient office spaces to ecofriendly procurement policies. Recognition 
and incentives are also offered to 
employees who demonstrate outstanding 
commitment to sustainability. Additionally, 
SLT empowers employees to propose and 
implement their own sustainability projects, 
encouraging innovation and ownership in 
creating a greener workplace.

of a relatively stronger position in the 
enterprise sector, with enterprise business 
contributing a larger share of revenue to 
our topline.

• Voice and collaboration
• Enterprise IoT
• Managed services


In 2023, the segment saw continued growth 
led by strong revenue growth from the SME, 
large and medium enterprise business. The 
success of our enterprise solutions have 
extended their reach, with entire sectors 
of Sri Lanka’s economy coming to depend 
on SLT for seamless connectivity and 
communication across their operations. 
Sri Lanka’s plantation sector is a key 
contributor to exports, and provides 
employment to thousands across the 
island. According to the International Labour 
Organisation (ILO) and the Employers’ 
Federation of Ceylon, smallholders still 
cultivate around 60% of the total tea land 
and account for over 70% of the country’s 
tea production.


Sri Lanka’s plantation sector has a 
significant representation of smallholders 
and SMEs. Our partnership with Itechro 
to support digitalisation of the plantation 
sector is a key initiative that would empower 
these enterprises and support their 
business success and continuity.
Innovating in the agritech space, SLT 
partnerships contributed to roll-out of 
the iHarvest digitalisation platform for 
the plantation sector. iHarvest will provide 
a cloud-based solution to digitalise field 
activity and operations, enabling enterprises 
to better facilitate field and estate 
management with greater transparency 
and better data-driven decision-making. 
Leveraging SLT Enterprise cloud services, 
iHarvest will be hosted on Akaza-Multi 
Cloud and made available to a wide range of 
Enterprise and SME customers. 
Beyond VPNs, internet connectivity, data 
centre solutions, leased lines, and specific 
application services, our cloud services 
continue to empower businesses with 
the agility and adaptability to scale, grow, 
and adjust to new ways of working in a 
competitive business environment. 
At a time where enterprises are favouring 
flexibility, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, 
we have embraced innovative and 
revolutionary solutions beyond the 
traditional offering of telecommunications 
service providers. With forward-looking 
investments in data centres made since 
2020, and forging of new partnerships with 
global technology leaders, we now stand 
as a comprehensive multi-cloud service 
provider offering four different cloud 
options. Additionally, we have expanded our 
services to include contact centre solutions 
through a partnership with Avaya, upgrading 
our system to a cloud-based platform.



Cloud computing in the information-age
• In a landmark achievement, SLT Enterprise’s Akaza multi-cloud service reached 1,000 customers in 2023, marking the success of our 
cloud offering
• SLT Enterprise partners with VMware to launch Sri Lanka’s first VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) deployment and double VCF Cloud
• “Unlock the power of Cloud-Native Application“ – an awareness session organised with a panel of Cloud experts. This session aimed 
to assist customers in navigating the cloud-related transformations through insightful discussions and meaningful exchanges.
Building on these accomplishment, we launched the highly anticipated VMware Double Cloud Service in March 2023. Incorporating 
dual-cloud architecture that capitalises on the strengths of two distinct cloud environments; this innovative approach delivers the scale 
and agility of public cloud with the security and performance of private cloud infrastructure. It provides enterprises with unprecedented 
flexibility, redundancy, and adaptability.
In addition, VCL carries the prestigious VM Ware Cloud Verified Certification, 
achieved in 2023. SLT is the first service provider in Sri Lanka to obtain the 
certification with VCF deployment; displaying our commitment to meeting the 
highest industry standards for reliability, security, and performance. It positions 
SLT’s offering as a trusted and certified solution within the VM Ware ecosystem.
We organised a customer awareness event titled “Unlock the Power of CloudNative Applications”, bringing together a panel of cloud experts, key medium and 
large enterprises, and government customers. The event explored the capabilities of SLT’s latest cloud offering and the potential for 
VCF to address customer challenges.
In 2023, SLT also partnered with Google Cloud to roll out use of Google Workspace communication and collaboration applications 
including Gmail, Chat, Meet, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and more to make the digital transition and transformation easier for 
SMEs. Integration and adoption of Google Workspace promises a host of efficiency improvements, while promoting hybrid work, and 
expanding collaboration across enterprise teams.


Enterprise’s Robust Partner Ecosystem



In 2023, we engaged with a number of 
innovative partners to widen our offering 
to enterprises. A new strategic partnership 
between our Digital Service Business 
and Surge Global is set to empower our 
marketing and software solutions offered 
to businesses to manage their digital 
ecosystems. Using localised knowledge 
and global best practices, the partnership 
promises to help enterprises set up and run 
ROI-driven campaigns, and take a datadriven approach to digital presence and 
initiatives.
Delivering Value to Micro, Small, 
and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)
Supporting digital enablement and 
empowerment of MSMEs is a strategic 
imperative under the Company’s strategic 
pillar of Driving a Smarter Sri Lanka. Our 
cost-effective enterprise solutions have 
enabled thousands of Sri Lankan MSMEs 
to take advantage of digital transformation 
opportunities, streamline their processes, 
and evolve their business models to meet 
changing market needs


In 2023, the introduction of new products 
expanded our suite of offerings, bringing 
added value to our range of products and 
services for MSMEs


BizLife, SLTM DataOne, and

comprehensive and affordable all-inone solution to businesses looking to

in an affordable, efficient, troublefree package. DataOne provides bulk 
data facilities for all the operations 
or divisions of a business enterprise, 
whilst the Hosting Cub facility enables

technology partners to stimulate and 
protect the ever-growing technology

with business chambers, government 
agencies and ministries, and other 

Institutions serving the MSME segment 
allow us to continue raising awareness, 
tune products and services, and roll-out

Consumers
SLT’s consumer business centres primarily 
on provision of fibre-based broadband, 
mobile products, entertainment products, 
and fixed-line services to individuals and 
households across the island. Maintaining 
a presence across the country enables 
the creation and maintenance of enduring 
relationships with our customers, which is 
one of our key differentiators. Our extensive 
network of touchpoints also provides a 
robust platform for customer acquisition 
and customer service. 
Consumer offering
• Fixed and mobile voice and data 
connectivity
• Bouquet of IPTV channels on PEOTV
• Value added services (VAS)
• Smart services
• Smart home, networking, and 
premises solutions
• Smart storage
Our unified touchpoints include localised 
regional teams and a strong network of 
dealer channels that contribute to sales and 
revenue. In the fixed-line business, external 
dealers make a significant contribution to 
the total revenue, while the mobile business 
relies heavily on strong connections with 
dealer channels, which play a crucial role in 
sales from the consumer business.


Strategic Approach to Drive 
Segmental Growth
Fixed-line
Aligned with a transformative trend across 
the globe where fibre-optics have spurred 
massive leaps in communication, fibre has 
grown to become the primary offering in our 
fixed-line business. Delivery of fibre to the 
home (FTTH) is an integral component of 
our vision for a smarter Sri Lanka and one 
of the central pillars of our growth strategy 
because of its remarkable bandwidth 
and speed. These elements make it a 
quintessential component of current and 
future consumer habits and lifestyles 
that are data-intensive and dependent 
on reliable, low-latency, high-speed 
connectivity. 
Despite having initially invested in laying 
an advanced fibre-optic based backbone 
network, additional capital expenditure 
(capex) was necessary for last-mile 
infrastructure to homes. Operational teams 
pioneered a proactive catchment-area 
concept to align further infrastructure 
investments to lay fibre loops in areas with 
the highest customer potential. Coupled 
with intensive campaigns to maximise 
customer acquisition while minimising line 
distances, the proactive strategy resulted in 
a minimal capex investment for line drawing 
and pole installation. Based on the success 
of these campaigns, we executed similar 
programmes in major locations with ample 
loops and potential households, surpassing 
the set fibre target by over 100%. 
For consumers who are not connected 
to fibre, SLT’s 4G LTE Home Broadband 
service offers a reliable and convenient 
solution. We provide attractive packages 
and data bundles to suit a variety of 
customer needs, prioritising convenience 
and flexibility. Additionally, customers can 
avail themselves of plug-and-play premise 
equipment that is simple to set up; allowing 
connection in minutes.
Sri Lanka’s economic crisis and worsened 
economic conditions of consumers and 
households, led to a notable increase in 
customer churn or dropping out postOctober 2022, worsening in the first 
quarter of 2023 due to new tax hikes. 
Comparatively high cost to customers was 
the primary driver for this churn. In light 
of these challenges, we made strategic

efforts to enhance the sales process and 
implement more stringent measures 
based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
that ensured new sales exhibited specific 
characteristics, which would minimise 
the likelihood of customer churn. This 
process involved a detailed and measured 
approach that evaluated each milestone of 
customer acquisition, including assessing 
the effectiveness of campaigns, validating 
sales orders, and confirming collection of 
documentation and initial payments.
Mobile
We employed a multi-pronged strategy to 
strengthen our customer base, beginning 
with leveraging synergies between our 
fixed-line and mobile business. Attractive 
packages and bundled services with value 
proposition surpassing market offerings 
coupled with incentivised cross-selling 
in areas with strong fibre presence led to 
positive outcomes. Retaining a focus on 
attracting new customers, while pursuing 
further cross-selling, we worked to tap 
youth through family packages that cater 
to the particular needs of households 
that were existing fibre customers. 
Simultaneously we re-strategised our 
operations in mid-2023, bolstering 
the partner network with a sustainable 
incentivisation programme, to alleviate the 
Company’s financial burden and contribute 
to stabilising the mobile business.
Entertainment
PEOTV offerings were enriched with 
True HD Content to enhance the viewer 
experience throughout the year with 
multiple live sporting events offered FoC 
as a value-add to the entire customers 
base. The Event TV Channel portfolio was 
increased to offer more airtime to locally 
produced content from schools, universities 
and other communities.
Additionally, competitive packages were 
introduced to penetrate the North and 
East pay-TV market and this initiative was a 
successful measure taken to increase new 
connections from the North and East.
The “On The Go Entertainment experience” 
was enhanced by extending content to 
the mobile screen, targeting the mobile 
customer segment to enrich their mobile 
TV experience with multiple events and 
content offered at affordable prices.


Customer Experience
Our specialised Customer Experience 
Team, together with SLT Management 
and all staff members across our 
touchpoints, provides a superior service 
experience to customers. Our efforts 
to enhance customer experience are 
enshrined in our strategy, with internal 
digitalisation efforts resulting in significant 
improvements to customers and the overall 
customer journey.
We have a group of Customer Experience 
Management Officers (CxEMOS) 
responsible for customer experience 
based at each touchpoint. They provide 
coordination for all staff members with 
Head Office Staff and other touchpoint 
owners to resolve customer issues as 
swiftly as possible. The team includes 
representatives from all internal stakeholder 
groups serving the SLT fixed line and 
mobile services. With continuous monthly 
training and review programmes, strong 
engagement activities, and annual 
conventions; we are committed to not only 
equipping our customer service teams, but 
also ensuring we listen and incorporate their 
knowledge of the pulse of customers. 
Alongside digitalisation efforts, we deployed 
a number of tools, such as Wi-Finder, which 
enable our teams and technical staff to 
install broadband routers at appropriate 
locations that have the strongest possible 
connectivity. Additionally, a Fibre-to-theHome (FTTH) tool is used to validate 
the quality of fibre connections. Analysis 
of customer behaviour and continuous 
assessment through a 3600 customer-view 
mobile app have also enriched our ability to 
serve customers. 
Customer experience highlights in 
2023
• SLT celebrated Customer Service 
Week 2023 by showering customers 
with exciting offers including bonus 
data bundles, discounts on devices, 
and special mCash benefits. The 
week-long celebration catered to 
both new and long-term customers, 
with a variety benefits for mobile and 
fixed-line users.



mAgent initiative launched at Group 
level - providing a unique, lowcost, area-based frontline service 
deployed to assist customers 
across Sri Lanka. The initiative 
onboarded and trained freelancers, 
enabling them to work as mAgents. 
SLT’s fixed and mobile customers 
calling 1717 could be connected 
to an mAgent in their area to 
access services with regard to new 
connectivity, device purchases, 
network diagnostics, and more. 
Mobilised mAgents could even 
attend via in-person visits to the 
premise when required.
• Silent Soldiers’ Night, a special 
forum organised by the Customer 
Experience Management Team, 
brought together the Company’s 
customer service officers to reward 
and value their service.
Boosting Speed and Convenience
We prioritised customer experience by 
increasing fibre download speeds to 
300 Mbps in all general packages; making 
browsing, streaming, and downloads 
faster than ever. Flexibility is ensured 
through a variety of packages to choose 
from, including standard free packages, 
anytime packages, unlimited flash packages 
and unlimited packages. Similarly, data 
add-ons allow customers to choose based 
on their needs, such as work and learn, 
entertainment, gaming, streaming, and 
messaging.
To provide greater convenience, we 
expanded our sales network through a 
network of dealers. This allows customers 
to access services closer to home. For 
high-end users, we introduced blazing-fast 
1 Gbps packages, catering to those who 
demand the ultimate internet experience. 
Tailored Offerings and Flexibility
Recognising diverse customer needs, 
we launched a variety of exciting offers 
including Happy Days where customers 
can enjoy unlimited internet access on 
designated days for a truly carefree online 
experience. Customers could also avail 
themselves of annual payment discounts, 
when paying up-front for a year of service. 
At the same time, to ensure flexibility, we 
also ensured customers had the option 
to employ instalment-payment plans 
to spread the cost of their connection


Combined or bundled packages were 
another feature that enabled our customers 
to obtain a customised combination 
of voice, TV, and internet services in a 
convenient and cost-effective package.
SLT’s innovative digital products and 
solutions described on pages 79 to 
80, benefit customers and the wider 
community.
Enhanced Home Connectivity
Catering to the proliferation of smart 
devices and the growing data and 
connectivity needs of our customers, 
we empowered customers to optimise 
their home Wi-Fi experience. Our Wi-Fi 
tending and mesh solutions work to ensure 
seamless connectivity throughout a home, 
allowing customers to enjoy reliable and 
uninterrupted connectivity across devices 
and locations.
Contact Centre
As connectivity and communications 
become ever more critical to individuals 
and businesses, SLT’s contact centre 
continues to play a vital role in providing 
immediate, urgent, and essential support 
to our customers. To meet customer 
expectations, the contact center prioritises

Customer Satisfaction
Continuous customer satisfaction is vital 
to assure the future of our business. We 
conduct daily, monthly, and quarterly 
customer satisfaction surveys to listen 
to the voice of our customers and annual 
surveys to derive insights on customer 
satisfaction through Customer Satisfaction 
Index (CSI) and Net Promoter Score 
(NPS), First Time Resolution Index and 
Time to Resolve Index. These surveys 
cover all customer segments, regions, and 
touchpoints. Our efforts contributed to SLT 
recording an improvement in customer 
satisfaction indices during the year.
Service Assurance
SLT has focused on reducing the number of 
faults reported, by effecting improvements 
to the access network, conducting quality 
improvements in customer premises 
equipment (service fulfilment), and 
conducting regular health checks of active 
network elements. Service assurance is 
further improved through the employment 
of multi-skilled workers in SLT’s field 
operations.
SLT’s contact centre plays a vital role in 
providing support services to all customers, 
by enabling access via various channels, 
mainly for fault reporting, bill inquiries and 
complaints, data (GB) requirements, and 
package modifications as inbound requests. 
Customers also reach out to the contact 
centre to obtain eChannelling, rail ticketing 
services, and for directory information. The 
contact centre serves customers mainly 
via an automated and digital platform, with 
the provision of obtaining agent assisted 
service upon customer request.
Cybersecurity
This year, cybersecurity was given greater 
prominence, in response to continuously 
increasing global threats and the surge in 
customer adoption of digital interactions 
and transactions, leading to increased 
vulnerabilities.
In alignment with global cybersecurity 
trends and addressing the unique needs 
within Sri Lanka, we have established a 24/7 
Security Operation Centre and introduced 
a Security Operation Centre as a Service 
(SOCaaS) in January 2024. Our adherence 
to ISO 27001 Information Security 


Management System across all operations 
and platforms ensures the highest security 
standards for our infrastructure and 
services. We empower our customers 
to implement tailored cybersecurity 
solutions, including network and application 
security. Additionally, to enhance their 
security posture, we offer customers the 
opportunity to conduct application and 
penetration testing, enabling a thorough 
assessment of their security, risk, and 
vulnerability levels.
SLT has further increased its efforts to 
educate and protect its clientele by hosting 
security seminars and conducting security 
awareness sessions for government 
entities and corporate customers. 
These initiatives are designed to elevate 
awareness and ensure that our clients are 
well-informed about potential security risks. 
Upholding our commitment to safeguarding 
our customers’ information, SLT considers 
the security of customer information as our 
utmost priority, actively assisting them in 
bolstering their cybersecurity defenses.
Customer Loyalty
SLT focuses on building a long-term 
relationship with existing customers, 
aimed at maintaining its customer base, 
minimising churn, and enhancing revenue 
growth, by delivering excellent service 
and enhancing customer convenience 
throughout all stages of the customer 
journey. To achieve this, various loyalty 
programme initiatives have been introduced 
to recognise long-term customers.
The Customer for Life programme is 
in place to enhance loyalty and provide 
updates on new product and service 
offerings directly to the customer. The 
service assurance priority also caters to 
Platinum customers, attending to faults and 
trouble tickets raised by them. In addition 
to the CRM system that includes a loyalty 
module, SLT’s points-based loyalty system 
helps to identify customer loyalty and the 
value of customers.
The insurance scheme for SME customers, 
in partnership with Ceylinco Insurance, 
provides a safety net at times of difficulty 
for customers. We are in the process 
of deploying technologies such as data 
analytics to drive customer service forward.

within the organisation


Key Achievements and Milestones
A range of innovative products have been 
introduced by SLT Services addressing 
the evolving needs of its clientele. As an 
ICT solutions provider, we deliver a broad 
spectrum of individualised solutions 
meeting customers’ requirements. We are 
a major player in providing in-building IP 
networking, communication, surveillance 
and other related ELV solutions in 
partnership with the major construction 
companies in the country. As part of our 
key offerings, we have enhanced our 
capabilities for large scale Tier Certified 
data centre development. Our software 
solutions serve several Government 
institutions and companies running our 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
and bespoke solutions, which we have 
developed in-house. SLTS banking platform 
is one of our flagship software products 
which is being continuously developed for 
new features and capabilities. Our banking 
platform currently serves one of the largest 
government community development 
banks with countrywide coverage. We have 
a strong focus on the information security 
domain as well. This year, we have been 
successful in delivering solutions for certain 
key state-owned universities as well as a 
large installation for SLT. 
During the course of this year, our ICT 
solutions arm achieved a significant 
milestone, winning the project for electrical 
and data centre infrastructure development 
for the SEA-ME-WE-6 international optical


fibre submarine cable landing station of SLT 
PLC located at Matara.

Overall Strategy and Related 
Initiatives
In pursuance of our vision to be the 
strongest and most trusted National 
Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) solutions provider with 
a complete portfolio of offerings, our 
strategy is to build our brand, and position 
ourselves as a trustworthy, responsive, 
and highly innovative organisation offering 
maximum local value addition for our all 
solution offerings. We enjoy a significant 
position of strength in the market, and are 
growing fast in the ICT domain. We have 
achieved considerable success in delivering 
on our strategy, in addition to surpassing 
revenue and profit targets for the year.
Enabling Customers to Navigate 
the Challenging Operational 
Environment
Our customers seek us out for highly 
specific and specialised projects, which are 
delivered on time, meeting all technical 
specifications, and output requirements. 


We take complete responsibility for the 
entire scope of turnkey projects – from 
planning and design, right up to delivery and 
commissioning.
The last few years have been the most 
challenging, due to the prevailing socioeconomic conditions, high inflation, and 
depreciation of the Sri Lankan currency, 
leading to cost escalations, and stiff 
competition to win limited projects in 
the market. Despite this challenging 
environment, we have sustained the 
Company, and grown it to a sizable extent 
while also making profits, which is a 
commendable achievement. Within the 
telco domain, we are exploring certain 
foreign development projects to extend our 
footprint further afield. We also collaborate 
with foreign companies as the ICT solutions 
contractor for large local projects.
We expect 2024 to be more promising as 
industries are opening-up, costs coming 
down, demand improving, and more 
opportunities arising for our SBUs.
Ensuring Reliability and Efficiency in 
the Face of Evolving Technology
We consider technological advancements 
as an advantage rather than a challenge, 
as we see new opportunities emerging 
with new technology for which we adapt, 
leveraging quickly our talent pool with 
direction from progressive leadership. 
We have the requisite talent in the form 
of our own certified engineers, who are 
also specially trained to adopt the latest 
technologies and bring cutting-edge 
solutions to our customers. Further, we 
partner with key technology providers, who 
are global brands, to deliver our solutions. 
We identify the best possible products 
having great future potential that we 
should carry, and offer them as part of 
our solutions, which helps us win against 
competitive offerings.
Fostering a Culture of Innovation
Our focus on innovation spans the provision 
of new technology to the market as well 
as in the software domain, in addition to 
working on new product development. 
This provides us with a distinctive edge in 
terms of adding value and earning profits. 
However, we are hampered by the dearth 
of human resources in related domains, 
which has emerged as a major challenge

that we are facing right now. Innovation 
is also facilitated by our partnerships with 
numerous local and foreign technology 
partners, who represent leading brands 
catering to particular solutions or domains.
Constant engagement with customers and 
feedback from our own staff and agents, 
helps us obtain in-depth knowledge of 
customer needs, which in turn enables us 
to improve our services, as well as engage in 
innovations where required. 
Focus on Sustainability of 
our Solutions
Sustainability remains one of our key areas 
of focus, especially in terms of solutions 
we offer, which are scalable, adaptable, 
customisable and sustainable in the 
long-term. We also ensure that these 
solutions are cost-effective at the outset 
and over their lifetime while requiring 
minimal maintenance. 
To assure our own Company of its 
long-term sustainability, the Management 
is highly detail-oriented, which includes a 
meticulous analysis of performance, future 
cash flows and profitability, with forwardfacing plans being made accordingly.
Training and Development 
for our Staff
We recruit our staff members from leading 
local and international universities and 
educational institutes using a stringent 
hiring process to ensure a proper 
technological and cultural fit with our 
Organisation. While our staff are highly 
qualified in their respective domains, we 
provide proper training based on project 
requirements, in addition to internal training 
programmes where we engage our own 
experts, as well as resource personnel from 
technology partners. Certification from 
technology partners is a prerequisite in this 
domain, which is carried out regularly.
Having such qualified and motivated staff, 
as well as the rich legacy and resources 
of SLT helps us keep abreast of the 
latest technological advances, which 
empowers us to be true to our vision of 
being the strongest and most trusted 
National Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) solutions provide


Digital Service Business
Our Digital Service Business focuses on two 
service lines: Marketing Services and Digital 
Engagement Solutions, utilising combined 
expertise and leveraging synergies to offer 
clients bespoke, best-in-class solutions. 
The business follows a technology-driven 
business strategy, positioning us as a 
leader in the ever-evolving marketing and 
technological landscape and ensuring we 
can meet the challenges and opportunities 
presented by the latest advancements.
Marketing Services – This pillar consists of 
Advertising and Marketing – which covers 
advertising (outdoor and online), branding 
(interior and exterior), creative content, 
animation, 2D /3D video production, 
motion graphics, as well email, SMS and IVR 
campaigns and promotions, in addition to 
information listing platforms, SEO content 
development and advanced local search 
engines.
Digital Engagement – This pillar covers 
digital marketing options, software, and 
digital platform. While directory platform 
was a one-way information driven business, 
we are in the process of converting it into 
an interactive, transactional platform, which 
can help engagement and loyalty building.
Outstanding Performance and 
Significant Achievements
During 2023, we were able to collect 
LKR 618 Mn. for the year, which is a 
significant achievement when considering 
the fact that we had only made the 
shift quite recently from our previous 
engagement in directory publishing.
As part of our new initiatives for the year, 
we have shifted to certain digital products 
such as a platform for school attendance 
and notification systems with the potential 
to scale up to more areas in the future. This 
will be offered free of charge, with the only 
payment being for the message notification 
charges for notifying parents. 
We have also made considerable progress 
in developing our own digital marketplace in 
the form of an e-commerce platform, which 
would aggregate sellers and connect buyers 
across Sri Lanka, in handling a multitude of 
products across a number of categories, 
and targeting various demographics.


#!--

As part of our digital platforms services, 
we have recently built an e-commerce 
platform for a client engaged in the 
hardware business, selling over 10,000 
products /stock keeping units (SKUs). This 
marks our most recent and largest foray 
into e-commerce. Most of our customerbase, which numbers over 3,000 SMEs and 
other ventures in various fields, are planning 
to transition their businesses to online 
platforms, giving us considerable scope to 
extend our footprint into the online domain.
Helping Stakeholders Excel in a 
Challenging Environment
Our stakeholders are mainly in the B2B 
sector, specifically SME businesses, in 
addition to government institutions, and 
retail organisations who have benefited in 
taking their businesses to the next level 
through the next-generation technological 
solutions we provide. We intend on taking 
this further, by reaching out and providing 
similar solutions to existing clients who have 
already been with us for a long period and 
part of our directory information business 
and advertising domain. 
Since a number of traditional businesses 
are likely to be taken over by their children 
who are more tech-savvy, we are moving 
towards providing them with specific and 
accurate information to help them navigate 
the complexities and challenges of the 
next generation in enterprise-building. 
For this segment, we have introduced 
digital marketing, advertising and software 
solutions to improve their businesses, in 
addition to software and tools such as 
Workflow Management System (WMS), 
E-Voucher System, Invoice Management 
System, Fleet Management system etc. 
which will help the next generation be a part 
of our roadmap to success.
Focusing on Niche Markets
Our current business directory functions 
as a national business directory, providing 
information on a wide range of private 
sector and government institutions, as 
well as products, brands, and various other 
categories. We have taken this a step 
further by identifying niche categories, 
around which a market and ecosystem 
can be built, connecting a wide variety of 
relevant stakeholders. One such niche


relates to “weddings as an industry” in 
which we have been engaged for a long 
period. Another industry is tourism which 
will benefit our country's economy by 
generating employment opportunities and 
earning foreign exchange. The third niche 
we have identified is the automobile sector, 
which connects a number of automobile 
industry products, services and events.
Building an ecosystem around a niche 
market involves tailoring products and 
services to address the specific needs of 
that segment while fostering partnerships 
with complementary businesses. By 
identifying unique characteristics and 
preferences, our Digital Service Business 
can establish community platforms, and 
provide value added services to further 
enhance customer engagement and loyalty. 
Innovation and Research in 
Developing New Offerings
This is one of the areas that we want 
to focus on, as forming international 
partnerships will be immensely helpful in 
terms of research and development, which 
will help us penetrate the global market. 
While insights from the SLT Research 
Centre will help us customise our solutions 
to the local market, the experience and 
technologies of global players can be a 
game-changer in maximising our potential. 
We have entered into a number of 
partnerships, which include a global 
software company, and growth marketing 
company to work with their product 
portfolio within the Sri Lankan context. We 
have also signed up with another technical 
partner, which helped us launch the school 
attendance notification system. While we 
do have our internal development team, we 
are quite open to the idea of collaborative 
models involving global players who are 
leaders in their respective domains.
Whatever solution we provide, be it 
software, web development or ecommerce 
the cybersecurity aspect needs to be 
considered as a priority concern. While 
engaged in hosting, cloud solutions, or 
data centre solutions, we rely on the SLT 
network, as well as the SLT data centre, 
which is among the most secure and 
certified data centres in the country. 
When working with global players, we rely

on Amazon and other reliable reputed 
organisations who offer the best in 
cybersecurity.
Supporting Small and 
Medium Enterprises to 
Leverage Digital Tools
This is one of the key areas that our 
Digital Service Business is engaged in at 
present, since we have sizable traditional 
businesses as part of our client portfolio. 
To take them to the next level, we carry out 
a meticulous analysis of their business and 
introduce them to our digital tools which 
are best-suited for their specific needs. For 
instance, in the case of brick and mortar 
operations, we first establish their online 
digital presence by using various means 
such as websites, ecommerce applications, 
online directories, virtual shops, and social 
media profile pages which will help bring 
online traffic to their business. As the next 
step, we offer digital marketing, social 
media campaigns, and search engine 
optimisation, in addition to blending their 
online and offline campaigns for maximum 
mileage. Introducing such solutions 
through our product portfolio also helps 
traditional businesses to embrace digital 
transformation. 
By synergising our Group capabilities, 
we help clients in terms of connectivity 
and other data solutions by offering fibre 
and PEOTV as per their needs. We also 
facilitate their transition to automation. 
A case in point is a pilot site of our client’s 
fleet management solution involving IoT 
applications which help the client to monitor 
and manage their vehicle fleet more 
efficiently.
We also provide clients with required 
software development solutions such as 
workflow management systems. These 
were especially helpful during the pandemic 
period when the workflow of employees 
working from home had to be managed 
effectively. Once we onboard such clients, 
we go on to propose relationship tools to 
manage staff and build loyalty. 
With our available resources, as well as 
highly competent personnel, we look 
forward to the coming year with confidence, 
and the resolve to advance our frontiers to 
new, uncharted territories


PEOTV Business
Our PEOTV Business follows an ambitious 
goal of becoming Sri Lanka’s largest video 
content hub. To this end, we work to 
aggregate, develop, store, and distribute 
content across various streaming platforms. 
We deliver content through two main 
channels: PEOTV (IPTV), a subscriptionbased service with wired connectivity, 
and PEO MOBILE (OTT), alongside other 
emerging OTT platforms.
SLT’s PEOTV offering is subscriptionbased, and offers several advantages over 
traditional television media like antennabased or Direct-to-Home (DTH). The wired 
connection enables interactive features 
like time-shifting, rewinding, and videoon-demand, significantly enhancing the 
customer viewing experience.
Focusing on Elevating 
Customer Experience
Our strategic emphasis remains on PEOTV, 
recognising the growing importance 
customers place on the quality of their 
viewing experience. This is best achieved 
through unparalleled high-definition (HD) 
picture quality delivered via the SLT fibre 
connection. Currently, PEOTV boasts the 
most extensive HD Content selection, 
including Local Free to Air channels in HD, 
most of which are exclusive to PEOTV. 
Aligning with global trends such as the rise 
of OTT and Entertainment On Demand, 
we aim to offer a diverse entertainment 
portfolio. Securing multiple Content rights 
for IPTV, OTT, and ad insertion throughout 
the year, particularly for major sporting 
events, has bolstered customer loyalty and 
revenue generation. To gauge customer 
satisfaction and integrate feedback for 
service enhancement, we have established 
a dedicated Customer Experience 
Management Team to collect customer 
input. Additionally, we conduct independent 
customer satisfaction surveys. Utilising the 
feedback received, we conduct internal 
analyses with cross-functional teams to 
gain insights into customer preferences, 
tailor or develop products, and establish 
pricing structures that ensure affordability



We also produce proprietary content 
distributed through our “Charana TV” 
channel, accessible on PEOTV, PEO 
MOBILE, cable TV platforms, and YouTube. 
Our original children’s content, “Sootikka,” 
comprising animated music and the novel 
initiative on animated storybooks for kids, 
is tailored for PEOTV, PEO MOBILE, and 
other digital platforms, aiming to generate 
supplementary revenue. Furthermore, we 
have successfully developed and launched 
an enhanced IPTV platform, laying the 
foundation for the implementation of 
cutting-edge features that will significantly 
elevate the overall customer experience.
Significant Achievements
During this period, PEOTV has achieved a 
commendable growth in revenue of 14%, 
while carefully optimising our operational 
costs which are sensitive to fluctuations of 
foreign exchange.
Our most significant achievement this 
year was the successful launch of our open 
standard Android-based, feature-rich 
Set-Top Box (STB), which has transformed 
conventional televisions into smart TVs, 
offering users an enhanced viewing 
experience. The open platform of our STB 
allows users to access a wide range of 
content and services from various providers. 
With the capability to receive software 
updates, our STBs enable customers to 
enjoy new features and enhancements over 
time, ensuring the device remains current 
and relevant.
The introduction of STBs has not only 
expanded our revenue streams but also 
enabled us to offer additional services 
such as premium content subscriptions, 
app downloads, and value-added services. 
Despite operational dependencies 
sensitive to forex fluctuations, our PEOTV 
Business has achieved commendable 
revenue growth by optimising our common 
operational processes

In 2023, Charana TV significantly increased 
its reach and popularity by introducing 
innovative programming concepts. Our 
channel’s dedication to showcasing diverse 
musical talent was recognised at the 
prestigious 29th Sumathi Awards, where 
“Kavi Dahayata Gee Dahayak” was awarded 
the Best Musical Programme of the Year. 
Charana TV’s programs have garnered 
numerous accolades, nominations, and 
placements throughout the year.
Training and Development
To ensure our staff remains at the forefront 
of industry advancements, we provide 
comprehensive training and development 
opportunities in product development, 
creativity, technology, and content. Our 
commitment to continuous learning is 
exemplified by ongoing technical training 
programmes that lead to certification for 
our employees.
Partnerships and Collaborations to 
Enhance Service Offerings
Our Company has established 
long-standing and mutually advantageous 
partnerships in both content and 
technology with prominent local and 
international entities. Furthermore, we have 
fostered close collaborations with proficient 
Sri Lankan content developers who face 
challenges due to limited resources, 
infrastructure, and licensing for operating 
a Free-To-Air (FTA) channel. In response 
to this issue, we have extended our 
support by offering them access to PEOTV 
as a platform. This platform serves as the 
single largest platform for non-FTA 
channels, providing a showcase for 
the talents and capabilities of these 
independent content creators.


Product and Marketing 
Services
The “Event TV” channel portfolio was 
enhanced and “PEO Sports” new channel 
line-up was initiated to facilitate multiple 
live events with more airtime offered to 
locally produced content from schools, 
universities and other communities, whilst 
streaming international sporting events 
simultaneously through a single platform, 
received positive comments from majority 
of the customer base. 
Competitive packages were introduced 
to penetrate the North and East pay-TV 
market as a successful measure to increase 
new connections.
Constant marketing focus was placed on 
promoting TV programming trends and 
titles showcased on both IPTV and OTT 
Platforms to enhance subscriptions and 
stickiness. Regional activations, sales 
trainings, digital promotions, SEO initiatives, 
user engagement via creative content 
creation are some of the key contributors 
for our success in the year 2023.


Looking to the future

We are focused on expanding our 
market presence in the fibre sector 
through PEOTV. Additionally, we 
have partnered with our sister 
company, Mobitel, to deliver popular 
and in-demand content to our 
mobile customer base, enhancing 
customer retention by offering 
affordable entertainment options 
on mobile devices. Our collaboration 
with global partners allows us to stay 
ahead of evolving market trends 
and technological advancements, 
providing our staff with opportunities 
to attend overseas conferences and 
enhance their knowledge base.
By participating in various global 
programmes and staying abreast 
of technological developments, we 
maintain a competitive edge in the 
industry. While our traditional delivery 
method has been cable-based, we 
are transitioning towards wireless 
solutions, particularly for enterprise 
clients and select hotels equipped 
with PEOTV wireless services. We 
are working towards offering wireless 
options to other customers, although 
wired connectivity currently offers a 
superior viewing experience.
In the near future, we are preparing 
to launch PEOTV services on 4G 
LTE, extending television services 
to the SLT wireless customer 
base. Recognising the importance 
of affordability, especially in light 
of economic conditions, we are 
committed to addressing this concern 
to ensure our services remain 
accessible to all customers

Important Initiatives 
Launched During the Year
In a strategic move towards fostering future 
leadership, Sri Lanka Telecom PLC unveiled 
its pioneering Executive Development 
Programme in 2023. With a vision to 
nurture adept leaders within the Company, 
this initiative was designed to fortify the 
competencies of handpicked executives, 
positioning them as the torchbearers of 
tomorrow.
The inaugural phase of this transformative 
programme saw the selection of 100 
executives from diverse echelons of the 
Organisation. These individuals embarked 
on an immersive journey through a 
comprehensive training series, crafted 
to augment their proficiencies across 
multifaceted domains.
The programme delved deeply into refining 
essential skills imperative for effective 
leadership and delivered over 10,000 
training hours. 


Talent Development Centres
We have introduced programmes extending 
beyond the Company. The SLT Talent 
Development Centre has introduced two 
fresh degree programmes: the BEng in 
Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, and the 
BSc in Data Science, in partnership with 
the University of Hertfordshire, UK. The 
programmes are meticulously crafted to 
meet the growing demand for expertise in 
these fields.
Our Development Centre has been 
authorised to function as an assessment 
body, granting National Vocational 
Qualifications (NVQ) Level 4 through 
the Recognition of Prior Learning 
(RPL) for occupational fields such 
as Telecommunication Technician, 
Telecommunication Tower Technician, 
Sales Assistant, Contact Centre Officers, 
Satellite TV, and Broadband Technician of 
the telecommunication industry. We have 
initiated the NVQ certification assessment 
process and are in the midst of evaluating 
our employees. This has enabled provision 
of NVQ4 qualification for 304 employees 
during the year.

.
Achievements


SLT Talent Development Centre has received approval from Pearson, UK, to serve 
as an accredited centre for conducting Pearson PTE examinations.
• Published a case paper titled “Developing Competency Assessment and 
Development Framework for Staff Engaged in Sales at Sri Lanka Telecom PLC” at 
the 7th CIPM International Research Symposium 2023. This publication showcases 
the SLT Talent Development Division’s dedication to enhancing the skills and 
capabilities of the sales workforce at SLT.
• The SLT Talent Development Centre has received prestigious accolades, being 
recognised as the “Emerging Centre of the Year 2022” and achieving the “Top 
Performing Centre 2022 – Bronze Award” during the Pearson BTEC Higher 
Education Forum 2023.
• SLT Talent Development Centre was recognised as the recipient of the 
“Best Managed Project in Academic Education” award at the National Project 
Management Excellence Conference and Awards 2023. This accolade 
acknowledges the Centre’s outstanding implementation of new infrastructure 
developments aimed at facilitating futuristic educational programmes



Additionally, we have implemented various 
enhancements across our operations, 
HR functions, and automation of HR 
processes. Currently, we have achieved 
approximately 80% coverage of all our 
processes, with plans for further progress 
in 2024. Furthermore, we have embarked 
on additional policy development and 
benchmarking exercises, including a review 
of our HR policies. These initiatives are vital 
as we strive to equip our Organisation with 
futuristic capabilities to meet the evolving 
competency requirements of the future.
We are focused on benchmarking with 
leading telecommunications organisations 
both domestically and internationally. 
Board approval has been secured for this 
pivotal project, scheduled to begin in 
2024. This initiative will involve establishing 
cadre levels to align with upgraded work 
methodologies. Furthermore, the adoption 
of new products and technologies will 
be tailored to suit the Organisation’s 
context. This stage will involve defining the 
organisational structure, considering the 
unified organisational context. Crucially, we 
can establish a competency framework for 
our personnel, ensuring that we evolve into 
a customer-centric Organisation.
Attracting the Best Talent 
Based on Future Needs
In terms of the younger demographic, 
we, along with other telecommunications 
companies and various industries in 
Sri Lanka, encounter a common challenge: 
attracting top talent. This demographic 
seems to prioritise flexibility, including 
remote work, hybrid arrangements, 
and project-based gig opportunities. 
Consequently, we are adapting to these 
preferences and are actively enhancing 
our flexible work arrangements to better 
engage with the new generation of talent. 
However, it remains a significant challenge 
to recruit and retain top talent, as a 
considerable number of qualified individuals 
are opting to leave Sri Lanka.


Further, in the backdrop of higher rate of 
brain drain in the country, we are evaluating 
new areas for attracting top talent. We are, 
also structuring the levels of talent that 
we want to attract, evaluating current and 
future needs. We need to optimise our 
talent to meet emerging needs, especially 
in terms of applications, solutions and 
software. The hiring of consultants would 
help us look at potential hires in terms of the 
skill set, rather than qualification.
Retaining Staff through 
Rewards and Recognition
Employees at SLT are regularly 
acknowledged through a variety of rewards 
and recognition programmes. These 
include the Call-Center Star Award and 
the Champions of the Month initiative. 
Each month, outstanding employees 
are commended in various categories 
such as RTOM (Regional Telecom Office 
Manager) of the month, OPMC (Outside 
Plant Maintenance Centre) Manager of the 
Month, REBM (Regional Enterprise Business 
Manager) of the month, Engineer SA&SF 
(Service Assurance and Service Fulfilment)
of the Month, Network Engineer of the 
Month, Sales Manager of the Month, and 
Channel Manager of the month. These 
accolades celebrate excellence across 
different roles and departments within the 
Organisation.
SLT’s employee engagement process 
encompasses various activities including 
biannual sales team faceoffs, religious 
events, club memberships, CSR initiatives, 
participation in sports events such as 
the SLT Games, and interactive seminar 
sessions. These initiatives aim to foster a 
sense of community, promote teamwork, 
and enhance employee satisfaction within 
the Organisation. Through a diverse 
range of engagement opportunities, 
SLT encourages active participation 
and collaboration among its employees, 
contributing to a positive work environment 
and overall organisational success.

Equitable Pathways for 
Career Progression
We take immense pride in our technical 
prowess within the industry, boasting some 
of the finest telecom experts in Sri Lanka 
across SLT, Mobitel, and associated 
subsidiaries. However, attracting top talent 
presents challenges due to the differing 
mindset of younger professionals towards 
legacy organisations like ours. While we 
strive to promote from within to leverage 
our Organisation’s expertise, particularly 
in areas such as the fibre network and 
nationwide infrastructure which are 
unique to us, recruiting externally can 
be challenging. Consequently, internal 
promotions are often prioritised, although 
we occasionally seek external candidates, 
particularly in non-engineering roles. Our 
selection process is meticulously structured 
and ingrained within the Organisation for 
every promotion and recruitment. These 
standards are periodically enhanced, 
ensuring transparency throughout the 
selection and promotion processes. 
Therefore, necessary revisions have been 
initiated for a new Staff Recruitment & 
Promotion Scheme (SRPS) that can meet 
our above requirement.
Given below are details of the performance 
management and career progression of 
staff.
• Made significant changes in the appraisal 
rating scale 
• Implementation of performance 
calibration process


Objective of performance calibration is 
to enhance fairness and accuracy of the 
performance management process.
When the annual performance assessment 
is carried out, a calibration committee 
engages with the process at two levels in 
the organisation.
a. Chief Officer level for calibration of General 
Manager and Deputy General Manager level
b. General Manager level calibration for rest of 
the organisation below them
• Implementation of Expert Path and 
People Manager Path
We embarked on clarifying career 
progression paths for our employees in two 
distinct directions.
a. Expert Path: Employees with deep 
understanding and proficiency in technical 
aspects of their respective functions can 
progress their career in this path.
b. People Manager Path: This is for employees 
who are willing to take their career on a tract 
where the responsibility of managing people 
increases.
Maintaining Enduring 
Relations with Staff Members
CEO’s Circular No: 50 /2023 on “Establishing 
industrial harmony through Committee for 
Inclusive Management (CIM)” was published 
in July 2023 with the view of improving the 
employee-employer relationship within SLT.
The Committee for Inclusive Management 
(CIM) proactively address grievances or 
concerns among our workforce before they 
escalate. This entails engaging with over 
20 trade unions, within Sri Lanka Telecom 
alone, to discuss their most urgent issues at 
the CIM, where resolutions are sought. 
Trade unions can easily raise their issues/ 
demands/concerns as well as share their 
ideas and proposals on Company growth 
initiatives etc. to a single point of contact 
so that such matters can be followed 
up and receive the responses from the 
correct stakeholder at CIM meetings. 
Similarly, management also can make their 
suggestions, explain and update the trade 
unions properly at the same forum. Also, it 
allows the Management to share important 
information, decisions, and organisational 
updates with employee representatives in a 
transparent and timely manner

The intended aims of the Committee for 
Inclusive Management (CIM) also includes 
several objectives: improving two-way 
communication, promoting employee 
engagement, resolving workplace issues, 
influencing decision-making, enhancing 
employee satisfaction, and boosting 
organisational performance. Additionally, 
the CIM aims for early identification of 
issues, fostering collaborative problemsolving, and increasing organisational 
flexibility. These objectives collectively 
support the CIM’s mission to create a 
more inclusive and effective management 
approach within the Organisation.
Grievance Handling and 
Whistle Blowing
The Grievance Handling Committee has 
been established for the expeditious 
settlement of employee grievances while 
ensuring the creation and sustenance of a 
healthy employer-employee relationship. 
The Committee will have oversight 
responsibilities, duties, and authority with 
respect to the grievances received from 
employees.
The Grievance Handling Committee meets 
at least once a month and at least three 
members shall be present in a meeting. 
The Committee considers only individual 
grievances of employees raised individually 
by the concerned aggrieved party. The final 
settlement of any grievance shall be made 
within a reasonable period (not exceeding 
one month) after the recommendations 
are submitted to the CEO by the Grievance 
Committee.
Additionally, we introduced a whistleblowing policy last year, a first for our 
Organisation, enabling individuals 
to anonymously report concerns or 
complaints through designated channels.
Whistleblowing procedure provides safe 
channels for Whistleblowers to report 
concerns about, suspected serious 
misconduct of SLT employees or any 
breach or suspected breach of law or 
regulation or conflicts of interest that 
may adversely affect the company, the 
company’s customers, shareholders, 
employees, investors or the public at 
large and to come forward and express 
such genuine concerns without fear of 
punishment or unfair treatment.

A Panel comprising four members, who are 
completely independent of SLT Group has 
been appointed to the Whistleblowing Unit 
to conduct preliminary investigations into 
any reported incidents (complaints). The 
Unit is required to carry out a preliminary 
investigation into the reported incident and 
identify whether there is a prima-facie case 
to proceed further with an internal audit /
forensic audit or investigation and submit 
a report to the Audit Committee, which will 
direct the Chief Internal Auditor and the 
CEO to take appropriate action.
The management will put in place a process 
to ensure that there will be no retaliation or 
victimisation against whistleblowers. The 
management expects all whistleblowers 
to use this mechanism to raise genuine 
concerns in a responsible manner in order 
to ensure its effectiveness.

 Furthermore, we have enhanced both 
the grievance procedure and the Code 
of Conduct. Certain processes are being 
redesigned and redeployed, considering our 
status as a unified organisation.
The merger necessitated the 
establishment of uniform standards 
and practices. Instituting a common 
competency framework will facilitate fairer 
decision-making regarding promotions, 
assessments, and recruitment processes. 
This framework will encompass leadership 
qualities, technical proficiencies, and 
standard procedures. Additionally, we are 
in the process of formalising a code of 
conduct, with process mapping already 
underway.

Additional measures taken with regard to 
furthering the interests of staff members 
include:
• Automation of many paper-based 
processes
• Implemented SLT-MOBITEL combined 
organisational structure
• Introduction of SLT Group Whistleblowing procedure
• Introduction of SLT Group Code of 
Conduct and Disciplinary Procedure
• Re-designing of Regional Telecom Office 
(RTO) structure
• Flexible duty off time for non-executives 
and transport assistance


Continued Focus on Training and Development
During the year, we launched numerous initiatives, resulting in an average of 22 hours 
of training per employee. Currently, we are actively engaged in rolling out the SMART 
Technician and SMART Sales Officer programmes. Within 2023, we have been able to 
develop 539 SMART Technicians and 55 SMART Sales Officers.

Ensuring Health and Safety of 
Employees
Ensuring the health and safety of 
employees is paramount for maintaining 
productivity, morale, and overall well-being. 
It fosters a positive work environment, 
reduces absenteeism, minimises accidents, 
and enhances employee retention. 
Moreover, it reflects the Company’s 
commitment to ethical and legal 
responsibilities, ultimately contributing to 
business success.
The Company continues to ensure the 
health and safety of employees as follows:
• Relevant procedures were developed 
for the established Health & Safety 
Management System
• Risk Management Process
• Incident Management Procedure
• Other procedures such as consultation 
and participation, management review, 
performance review
• Steering Committee was established 
and a steering committee meeting was 
held to review the progress of health and 
safety initiatives
• Several health and safety audits were 
carried out at SLT HQ, Welikada and other 
regional premises
• Improvement to the established health 
and safety management system and the 
application was submitted to SLSI for 
certification with reference to ISO /IEC 
45001:2018
• Employee health screening programme 
conducted every year to assess 
employees’ health – SLT Suwatha 
Programme
• Medical benefit scheme which provides 
financial assistance for medical expenses
• Agrahara Insurance Scheme, financial 
assistance for medical expenses
• Arranging counselling programmes as 
and when required for employees
• Programmes arranged for physical fitness
• Expenses on treatments for critical illness



The Process of Managing Changes within the Organisation
As we implement organisational changes, particularly in people management, we 
encounter the need to further convince the value of the change. This resistance stems 
from management advocacy for change and staff acknowledgement of its importance in 
navigating the evolving technological landscape. Currently, we are addressing operational 
issues and aligning employees with our chosen direction, which has been a positive process 
overall, albeit with expected challenges. We have laid the groundwork for impactful people 
management changes and plan to fully execute these plans in the coming year

Partners and Suppliers


The telecommunications landscape is a 
complex web of interconnected services. 
In today’s dynamic market, our business 
success hinges on effective collaboration. 
As such, prioritising long-term strategic 
partnerships with key suppliers and business 
partners is a strategy that continues to hold 
forth for SLT. 
Our partnerships with global and local 
players contributes to achieving business 
goals and objectives, including positioning 
us to deliver cost-effective solutions 
that cater to the diverse needs of our 
customer segments. Partnerships also 
foster innovation, enabling development 
of groundbreaking solutions that spread 
benefits to a wider group. By contributing 
to developing a robust network of partners, 
we remain committed to strengthening 
Sri Lanka’s digital and telecommunication 
ecosystem, and ensuring a seamless and 
efficient flow of services to end-users.
In 2023, SLT became a service 
provider to join the Oracle 
PartnerNetwork (OPN). This 
achievement would enable the 
Company to offer enhanced 
enterprise application development, 
cloud integration, and application 
management services to clients. 
Access to Oracle products like 
Exadata, Database Appliance, Oracle 
VM, Oracle Enterprise Manager, 
Oracle SQL Developer, and Oracle 
Solaris 11 would empower clients 
with reliable licenced software to run 
critical workloads on a scalable and 
secure cloud infrastructure.
Supplier Relationships
We employ diverse strategies to efficiently 
manage relationships with suppliers, 
ensuring a cost-effective and seamless 
procurement process, along with the 
timely delivery of contracts and products, 
adhering to global standards and SLAs. Our 
achievement of necessary cost-efficiencies 
and economies of scale in purchases can 
be primarily attributed to our practice of 
negotiating as a group, instead of individual 
entities negotiating independently. Notably, 

we have consolidated annual maintenance 
Contract (AMC), particularly in IT 
investments. Adoption of a unified licensing 
model and consolidated AMC negotiations, 
provides us with strengthened negotiating 
power, enhanced pricing, and other benefits 
that we can extend to customers. 
Updates to our procurement approval 
process, has continued to bring positive 
results through faster tender processes 
for our suppliers. The Company’s global 
price benchmarking exercise, for frequently 
procured items, has succeeded in 
maximising price and term benefits while 
strengthening our direct relationships with 
suppliers.
In our commitment to consistently achieve 
Service Level Agreements (SLAs), we 
emphasise the importance of effective 
measurement and monitoring. Whether 
it is SLAs or Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs), we advocate for a robust monitoring 
mechanism. To facilitate this, we are in the 
process of developing specific dashboards 
that allow us to monitor various stages of 
processes, such as procurement, payment, 
and inventory management, including the 
reaching of economic order levels and 
the timing for triggering the next order. 
The implementation of these dashboards 
equips decision-makers with accurate data 
crucial for business success.
Strengthening the Supply 
Chain
SLT’s suppliers play a vital role in delivering 
the technology and resources that keep 
Sri Lanka connected. From network 
management to facilities management, 
our operational divisions, Procurement 
Department, and Group companies all 
collaborate extensively with a wide range of 
partners. Throughout our engagements, 
we prioritise building strong, collaborative 
relationships that would bolster the 
telecommunications supply chain.
SLT has implemented a comprehensive 
supplier management programme for the 
Group that includes a rigorous selection 
process, continuous investment in the 
capabilities of suppliers, and transparent 
communications and engagement.


• Suppliers are evaluated and ranked 
based on a well-defined set of criteria 
encompassing quality, reliability, 
innovation, sustainability practices, and 
competitive pricing. This ensures we 
partner with reliable and forward-thinking 
companies – in Sri Lanka and overseas.
• Supplier development entails training 
programmes, awareness forums, 
and other knowledge-sharing and 
collaborative problem-solving 
opportunities.
• Open tenders and proactive 
communication, keeps suppliers 
informed of future needs; allowing for 
better planning, reduced risks, greater 
efficiency, and mutual benefits for parties 
involved.
Partnerships, Alliances, and 
External Associations 
SLT has built a network of partnerships with 
local and international business entities and 
other service providers. The relationships 
built with the Government, enterprise 
customers and domestic operators are 
considered mutually beneficial and continue 
to contribute towards SLT’s mission of 
innovating for the future. 
Partnerships include those with national 
institutes to facilitate the growth of 
Micro and SME business segments and 
undertake initiatives relating to stakeholder 
engagement, professional and industry 
networks, market traction, solution 
modelling, and joint offers. These include:
• The National Enterprise Development 
Authority
• The National Chamber of Exporters
• The Small Enterprise Development 
Authority
• CA SME Task Force
• ICT Agency of Sri Lanka


Partner-of-choice for projects and development
SLT continued to lead the field in 
providing data, communications, and 
digital services to leading development 
projects across the Country. Our sought
after products, reliable services, and strong 
partner-relationships make us a valuable 
collaborator for large-scale residential, 
mixed-use, and commercial projects

Community and Country


As the National Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) solutions 
provider our business is intrinsically 
linked to the digital and communication 
needs of the nation. We capitalise on 
our position to create value for millions 
of Sri Lankans by ensuring our products, 
services, and initiatives actively contribute 
to the development of the country and its 
communities.
Our ESG initiatives are founded on the 
theme of “Sabandiyawe Sathkaraya”
(Respecting the Nation), and align with the 
United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (UN SDGs). They represent the 
Company’s strong commitment to 
Environmental, Social, and Governance 
(ESG) principles. These activities focus 
on three key pillars: Nature, Education, 
and Healthcare. We also embrace our 
responsibility towards connecting, 
enabling, and uplifting community 
activities in the realms of sports, culture, 
and entertainment; through a fourth pillar 
providing sponsorships to community 
institutions, events, and activities.
As part of our community development 
initiatives, and supporting Sri Lanka’s 
national vision of bridging the digital 
divide, Mobitel brought connectivity to 
over 150 families in Meeyagala, a remote 
village in the Monaragala District. As the 
sole connectivity provider in the area, our 
efforts created essential access to cuttingedge voice and broadband solutions, 
transforming daily life for residents. In line 
with the Group’s focus on education, the 
initiative also empowered the village with a 
donated library and computer lab; equipping 
hundreds of students with necessary tools 
to connect to the digital world


Empowering National Endeavours 
Alongside targeted ESG initiatives, and 
product offers and promotions, our 
engaged presence at key events has the 
potential to extend SLT’s positive impact 
to thousands more Sri Lankans. During the 
course of the year 2023, we were proud 
to sponsor, participate in, and attend a 
number of events including the National 
IT Conference - NITC 2023, INFOTEL 
2023 ICT Exhibition, the Techno 2023 
Engineering and Technology Exhibition; 
South Asia Network Operators Group 
(SANOG) Conference, DevFest Sri Lanka 
2023, IESL Robo Games 2023, International 
Book Fair 2023, and the #ConnectSL 
interactive forum.
Our support for key professions and sectors 
of the economy included sponsorship 
of the National Project Conference & 
Excellence Awards (NPME) 2023, the Global 
CEO Forum (Sri Lanka), CIPM National 
HR Conference 2023, CMA National 


Management Accounting Conference 
2023 and the “Prathiba Abhisheka” Women 
Entrepreneur Awards 2023 organised 
by the Women’s Chamber of Industry & 
Commerce (WCIC) Sri Lanka.
Long-term partnerships with Gamerlk 
continued to support the hosting 
of inter-university and mercantile 
e-sports Championships, giving youth a 
dynamic platform to demonstrate skills, 
determination, sportsmanship, and 
professionalism in e-sports.
In addition, our connectivity and digital 
solutions for the Asia Pacific Advanced 
Network (APAN56) Conference, supported 
knowledge-sharing and collaboration on 
cloud technologies, IoT, IPv, security, AI, 
driven networks and routing. 
SLT also rolled-out industry-leading 5G 
trial technology to power the 86th Nuwara 
Eliya Golf Club (NEGC) Championship; 
introducing immersive real-time sports 
broadcasting.


SLIoT Challenge: Industry 4.0
The annual IoT competition organised 
by the Department of Computer 
Science & Engineering, University of 
Moratuwa in collaboration with The 
Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka 
(IESL), is powered by SLT. The event’s 
2023 iteration was themed Industry 
4.0, representing the transformative 
potential of the “fourth industrial 
revolution” fuelled by advancements 
in digital technologies, automation, 
and data exchange. The SLIoT 
Challenge provided an engaging 
and rewarding platform for students 
and undergraduates to showcase 
innovative ideas and troubleshoot 
smart solutions incorporating IoT 
technology.

Day of Code 2023
SLT and STEMUP Educational 
Foundation partnered to host the 
“Day of Code 2023”, with the aim 
of encouraging interest in and 
advancement of computer science 
education among Sri Lankan students 
and educators. This is the second 
consecutive year the event was 
organised, in line with the Computer 
Science Education Week (CSEdWeek) 
held in December 2023.


Environment and Education
Alongside efforts to reduce the 
environmental footprint of our 
operations, the Company is involved in 
raising awareness and promoting better 
environmental practices through our ESG 
initiatives. As part of the “Rata Pura Husmai 
Pohorai Waga Karamu” initiative, which aims 
to improve air quality, reduce emissions, and 
promote healthier soil, we carried out tree 
planting and book donation programmes 
at several schools across the island. The 
projects initiated renovations of school 
libraries, donated a variety of books, and 
enabled planting of tree saplings. The 
project is expected to benefit over 2,000 
students by enriching their knowledge and 
inculcating the habit of reading.



Our efforts to support STEM education 
and foster innovation are strengthened by 
collaborations with leading institutions and 
secondary and tertiary education providers. 
With the long-term goal of equipping and 
future-proofing an empowered Sri Lankan 
workforce, we are also contributing 
to creating a pipeline of talent for the 
Country’s technology sector.
In 2023, we partnered with the STEMUP 
Educational Foundation to empower 
student entrepreneurship through STEM 
education. The initiative conducted an 
enlightening “Hour of Code” workshop, 
made contributions via the “Sithak Athnam 
Pothak Denna” book donation programme, 
repaired and re-equipped school computer 
labs, and promoted environmental 
awareness through tree-planting projects.


CoderDojo
Focused on younger students, aged eight 
to sixteen, SLT and STEMUP Educational 
Foundation founded the CoderDojo skill 
development programme to drive STEM 
learning opportunities and coding, while 
promoting critical thinking, creativity, and 
analytical skills. Now in its second year, the 
programme is conducted at three Nebula 
Institute of Technology centres and fifteen 
public libraries across the Island; continuing 
to spark the interest of hundreds of youth. 
In the long-term, efforts like these are 
contributing to close the Nation’s ICT 
skill-gap and usher in a technologically 
advanced, digital economy.


Empowering Technopreneurs – 
mSpace Code Blast 
Hackathons are key events organised 
around the globe to ignite the developer 
community, foster innovation, and develop 
solutions to real-world problems. In 2023, 
Mobitel organised the National Hackathon 
- mSpace Code Blast, which was held on 
the mSpace platform. The event provided 
a unique opportunity for coders and 
non-coders alike to collaborate, promoted 
entrepreneurial spirit, and empowered 
youth with support to transform their ideas 
into viable business solutions

Health
SLT stepped up to address the critical 
shortage of essential drugs in state-run 
hospitals. A contribution of LKR 8 Mn. worth 
of medications across eight provinces 
was aimed at ensuring patients have 
access to necessary treatments, including 
anaesthetics, medications for hypertension, 
antibiotics, and other life-saving drugs.
As part of our commitment to support 
the healthcare sector and better health 
for Sri Lankans, SLT Group donated vital 
medicines and essentials goods to the 
Apeksha Hospital in Maharagama, to 
commemorate International Women’s 
Day. In another milestone, the Group’s 
eChannelling platform launched an 
innovative Eco Channelling service. This 
service personalises medicine delivery by 
offering doorstep distribution, powered 
by the Group’s newly launched mAgent 
network.
Promoting a Digital Sri Lanka
• Communications Infrastructure 
(National Backbone Network), Smart 
government
• eSports, eChannelling, FinTech 
(mCash), online ticketing,
• Educational services, learning 
platforms
• School digitalisation services
• Directory services
• National Backbone Offerings
• Government Service Digitalisation 
Solutions
Our core business extends beyond 
the products and services SLT offers. 
Promoting digitalisation and improving the 
way Sri Lankans live, work, and experience 
life isn’t just a business strategy; it is an 
ethical imperative. Many of our efforts 
serve as catalysts for the Country’s 
digital transformation, transforming or 
revolutionising entire sectors. 


On the ground-level, we are involved in 
maintaining, upgrading, and extending 
the communications infrastructure 
that undergirds most all of our digital 
communications. Our advanced fibre-optic 
National Backbone Network (NBN) serves 
as the primary backbone behind Sri Lanka’s 
ICT infrastructure. 
Beyond this, we are involved in pursuing the 
goal of Smart, digitally-enabled government 
services – through the Lanka Government 
Network (LGN) and other initiatives that 
are making civil services more efficient 
while improving access, usability, and 
convenience for millions of Sri Lankans.
Whether it is increasing convenience 
through digitalisation for the health sector, 
through eChannelling; advancing mobilemoney and digital financial transactions, 
through mCash; or changing the way 
Sri Lankans book tickets, find and access 
services, or monetise their skills; SLT is 
re-engineering essential services that are 
quickly becoming part and parcel of our 
daily lives.
Duthaya
Recognising the growing demand for 
affordable, customised assistance in 
a fast-paced world, SLT launched the 
“Duthaya” app. The application provides 
an online and mobile marketplace 
that seeks to bridge the gap between 
people and services, by connecting 
users to freelancers who can support 
them with a variety of everyday tasks. 
The app already supports over 100 
applications ranging from paperwork, 
deliveries, banking, government or 
business services. It would be of 
particular use to busy professionals 
and expatriates looking for efficient 
completion of services on their behalf



Fazenda Smart-Agro Solution
SLT is pioneering a digital solution that 
integrates IoT and AI technology to 
support Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector. 
The solution empowers farmers with 
real-time data on their crops, allowing 
them to make informed choices for

application. Developed by The Embryo, 
SLT Group’s pioneering Research 
and Development initiative, Fazenda

piloted at multiple locations including 
a pilot project at the University of 
Peradeniya and commercial pilots 
in a few locations. As a next step, 
SLT is partnering with agronomists 
and technical experts to scale and 
develop the smart-farming solution for 
large-scale farms.
Recognised for its contribution to 
agriculture innovation, the solution 
received a merit award, in the 
Agriculture category – Industrial 
Sector, at the National ICT Awards 
NBQSA 2023. It also received a silver 
award for Best Managed Project 
in the Agriculture and Livestock 
Development Sector, at the National 
Project Management Excellence 
(NPME) Awards 2023. Fazenda’s AI 
and ML solution – Racoon-AI, received 
Gold for Best Managed project in the 
Robotics and Artificial Intelligence 
sector.
Entertainment is another major area 
in which we are creating change. Our 
eSports platform and related initiatives 
and partnerships for the eSports sector 
continue to provide thousands of hours of 
entertainment, while creating opportunities 
for Sri Lankans to engage in eSports at a 
professional level. Meanwhile, we are going 
beyond our own entertainment offering to 
create and promote new channels that will 
reach an even wider audience.


HitFlix
In 2023, we launched HitFlix – a 
premier channel streaming curated 
Sri Lankan content, available on 
AppleTV, ROKUTV, FireTV, IOS and 
Android. HitFlix hosts a vast library of 
Sri Lankan movies, TV shows, anime,

partnership with leading content 
providers and channel owners. This 
ground-breaking initiative aims to 
bring the richness of Sri Lankan 
culture, content, and entertainment 
to expatriates worldwide and captivate 
the interest of international audiences 
seeking authentic Sri Lankan 
experiences.
In the field of education, we are at the 
forefront of developing and rolling out 
school digitalisation services through our 
Digital Service Business; continuing a foray 
into e-learning on digital platforms, such as 
eSiphala; and delivering other educational

confirmed/ratified at the subsequent 
immediate regular Board meeting.

reports were circulated to the Directors 
electronically by uploading them to the 
Board meetings application System, 
“BoardPAC” and accessed by the Directors

Indemnities to Directors and 
Liability Insurance Cover
The Company’s AoA provides for indemnity 
to be extended to Directors up to the 
extent allowed by law for liabilities arising 
from the performance of their duties in 
their capacity as Directors of the Company. 
However, this indemnity does not apply if a 
Director is found to have acted fraudulently 
or dishonestly. Throughout the year, 
the Company has upheld Directors’ and 
Officers’ Liability Insurance coverage.
Remuneration of 
Non-Executive Directors
The RC evaluates and suggests 
remuneration for Non-Executive Directors, 
subject to Board approval. Compensation 
for Non-Executive Directors includes fees 
for attending Board and subcommittee 
meetings. Details of the total Directors’

2023 are provided in Note 7 of the Financial 
Statements. In addition, all other expenses 



including travelling and accommodation 
incurred by overseas Directors in attending 
the Board and subcommittee meetings are 
reimbursed by the Company.
Role of the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer
The distinction between strategic and 
operational matters is clearly delineated by 
the division of duties between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). As a 
non-executive role, the Chairman of SLT’s 
Board primarily focuses on strategic affairs, 
ensuring adherence to Board procedures 
and facilitating active participation of all 
members during meetings.
The CEO assumes responsibility for the 
day-to-day management of the business 
and provides guidance to the executive 
team. Additionally, the CEO oversees the 
implementation of the Company’s strategic 
and operational plans. Regular meetings 
between the Chairman and CEO are held to 
address issues concerning the Company’s 
performance, operational affairs, human 
resources and matte


CEO Performance Evaluation
The Board assesses the CEO’s 
performance each year against 
pre-established performance criteria, which 
were mutually agreed upon at the beginning 
of the year by the NGC and the Board. The 
evaluation of the CEO’s performance and 
determination of compensation are based 
on this assessment and are collectively 
agreed upon by both parties.
The Company Secretary 
The Company Secretary reports directly 
to the Board and is accessible to individual 
Directors regarding Board procedures. 
In addition to assisting the Chairman 
with delivery of the agenda, especially in 
planning the annual cycle of Board and 
Board Committee meetings, the Company 
Secretary ensures timely provision of 
detailed information to Board members. 
While providing guidance to Directors 
on Board procedures and corporate 
governance matters, the Company 
Secretary also serves as the Secretary to all 
Board subcommittees.



Being qualified as an Attorney-at-Law and 
an Associate Member of the Chartered 
Governance Institute, United Kingdom, the 
Company Secretary has been designated 
as the person responsible for shareholder 
communication, acting under the guidance 
of the CEO.
The appointment or removal of 
the Company Secretary is a matter for 
the Board as a whole.
Remuneration of Senior 
Management
The remuneration framework and policies 
are structured to assess employees’ 
work performance in alignment with the 
Company’s objectives and strategies. As 
such, suitable corporate and individual 
performance metrics are established, 
considering medium and long-term 
goals, as well as year-end performance 
assessments. Competitive compensation 
packages are provided to attract and retain 
highly skilled and talented individuals.
The CEO of SLT serves as the leader of the 
Management team and is consequently 
compensated as a member of Senior 
Management. The RC proposes the salary 
package for the CEO, ensuring it reflects the 
qualifications and experience, for approval 
by the Board.
Corporate Ethics
SLT has compiled a comprehensive Code 
of Conduct, applicable not only to its 
employees but also to third parties engaged 
with the Company. This Code outlines 
principles that uphold the highest standards 
of personal and corporate integrity 
in interactions with SLT, competitors, 
customers, suppliers, and the community. 
By adhering to the processes and standards 
outlined in the Code, investor confidence is 
bolstered, and decision-making is steered 
towards the Company’s best interests.
Covering various aspects such as equal 
opportunity employment, workplace safety, 
business ethics, asset protection, data 
security, and conflict of interest, the Code 
is accessible on SLT’s internal website. 
Clear policies and standards are outlined to 
provide employees with guidance in their 
daily responsibilities


Financial Acumen, 
Internal Control and Risk 
Management
The existing internal control framework 
is established through the integration 
of the risk management framework, 
financial control measures, internal audits, 
and supporting policies. SLT’s internal 
control structure is designed to enhance 
operational efficiency and alignment 
with the Company’s strategic objectives. 
Moreover, it ensures the provision of 
accurate, dependable, comprehensive, and 
timely financial reporting and management 
information for stakeholders. Rooted in 
ethical values, the framework operates 
under principles of sound corporate 
governance and risk management 
solutions.
SLT employs systematic risk management 
strategies to develop the efficiency and 
control of business operations, as well as 
their profitability and continuity.
Related Party Transactions 
and Material Contracts
The Board of Directors adheres to 
regulations outlined by the CSE regarding 
related party transactions to mitigate 
potential conflicts of interest. To reinforce 
corporate transparency and ensure 
equitable dealings between SLT and its 
subsidiaries, a RPTRC has been established 
under the purview of the Board of Directors. 
SLT maintains related party relationships 
with its subsidiaries, as disclosed in 
Note 33 of the Financial Statements. The 
Board perceives these transactions to be 
exempted per exceptions specified in the 
Code of Best Practices on related party 
transactions issued by the CSE, deeming 
them recurring and customary in the 
Company’s regular operations.
SLT and its subsidiaries have not entered 
into any significant contracts involving the 
interests of the CEO, Directors, controlling 
shareholders, Secretary to the Treasury, or 
Global Telecommunication Holdings N.V.

Major Transactions
In compliance with Section 185 of the 
Companies Act, the Board of Directors 
informs shareholders concerning all 
proposed corporate transactions, 
providing comprehensive details regarding 
any material aspects relevant to SLT. 
Notably, SLT did not engage in any major 
transactions during the year 2023.
Whistle-Blowing Policy
SLT has established an effective Whistleblower programme to protect the 
integrity and reputation of the Company, 
augment its framework of internal controls 
and provide a channel for employees 
to report inappropriate activity and 
ethical concerns of which they may be 
aware. Employees are educated and 
encouraged to raise any concerns affecting 
compliance culture of SLT through the 
whistle-blowing mechanism. The Whistleblower Committee comprises of three 
independent members selected from 
various professions and expertise outside 
the Company. The matters reported are 
diligently investigated and recommended to 
the Audit Committee of SLT for appropriate 
action to be taken. The Company is 
committed to Whistle-blower protection 
and maintaining confidentiality. 
Communications with 
Shareholders and Annual 
General Meetings
The AGM is used for constructive 
engagement with investors, and all 
shareholders are encouraged to participate. 
Chairpersons of subcommittees are 
present at the AGM specifically to answer 
any queries from shareholders.
The Company is in compliance with the 
requirements stipulated under Regulation 
9 of the Listing Rules of the CSE as 
amended from time to time and as 
applicable with regard to Corporate 
Governance

Enterprise Risk Management


In the rapidly evolving telecommunications sector, risk management 
emerges as a critical priority for companies striving to navigate 
uncertainties while ensuring the safety of customers and stakeholders, 
securing the Company’s assets, and fostering growth. For SLT, a leading 
telecom entity, this commitment to risk management is not just about 
mitigating threats but also about leveraging opportunities that arise 
amidst these challenges. The integration of risk management into SLT’s 
operations is designed to enhance decision-making processes, thereby 
aligning the Company’s risk assessment and response strategies with its 
overarching strategic objectives.


Risk Leadership and Governance
At the core of SLT’s risk management ethos is the belief that effective 
leadership and governance are indispensable. The Company’s Senior 
Management plays a pivotal role in embedding a risk-conscious 
culture throughout the Organisation. Through the establishment of 
a comprehensive risk management framework, SLT delineates its risk 
management philosophy, appetite, tolerance levels, and the approach 
towards identifying, assessing, and addressing risks. This framework is 
vital in guiding the Organisation through the complexities of various risk 
types, including those that could significantly impact SLT’s reputation, 
operational efficiency, human resources, and financial health. By 
fostering an environment where risk management is vigorously 
supported and actively engaged in by the leadership, SLT ensures 
that risk considerations are integral to the formulation of key business 
strategies and decisions.
Audit Committee
The governance structure of SLT’s risk management efforts is anchored 
by the Audit Committee, which doubles as the Risk Management 
Committee (RMC). Endorsed by the Board of Directors, the RMC 
represents the highest level of risk management oversight within the 
Company. This Committee is instrumental in overseeing the Enterprise 
Risk Management (ERM) function, ensuring that risk management 
practices are not only implemented but also aligned with the Company’s 
strategic direction and operational requirements.
ERM Standards
SLT’s adherence to the ISO 31000:2018 guidelines underscores its 
commitment to a structured and effective risk management approach. 
The incorporation of these standards into its ERM framework is 
complemented by SLT’s initiative to integrate best practices developed 
within the Organisation, thereby enhancing the robustness and 
relevance of its risk management efforts.
Risk Process and Activities
The dynamic nature of the telecommunications industry, compounded 
by external factors such as economic crises and technological 
advancements, necessitates a proactive and agile approach to risk 
management. In 2023, SLT navigated through a plethora of risks, 
including financial instability due to exchange rate volatility. Against this 
backdrop, SLT’s approach to risk management emphasises simplicity, 
clarity, and efficiency across all business domains. This strategy enables 
the Company to foster a culture of shared responsibility, aggregate 

isks, and ensure consistent application of its risk management 
practices. Through a systematic and rigorous risk review process, SLT 
remains adept at identifying, monitoring, and managing risks, thereby 
safeguarding the Company’s interests and ensuring business continuity.
The Company has been facing a number of critical risks to sustain and 
ensure its business continuity. These, among others, included:



| Risk                                                               | Description                                                                                                                      | Risk Level |

| Risk of OPEX increases to manage business operations               | Effective cost management initiatives implemented to minimize the effect of increasing energy and other costs.                   | Critical   |
| Liquidity risk                                                     | Managing risk of collections, bad debt, and delayed bill payments due to prevailing conditions.                                  | High       |
| Impact to critical business functions due to employee turnover     | Country-wide brain drain is impacting talent retention.                                                                          | High       |
| New industry-specific policies and taxes                           | Ongoing discussions with industry stakeholders.                                                                                  | High       |



SLT’s dedicated approach to risk management, supported by strong 
leadership, governance structures, adherence to international 
standards, and comprehensive risk processes and activities, positions 
the Company to effectively manage the spectrum of risks it faces. This 
strategic orientation not only protects SLT from potential adversities but 
also empowers it to seize growth opportunities, thereby reinforcing its 
commitment to stakeholders and securing its position as a leader in the 
telecommunications sector



Despite the challenges faced in 2023,
we are resolutely optimistic about the future
as Sri Lanka’s economy is expected to return
to growth in 2024 and evolution in the
technological landscape indicates SLT
is well-positioned to lead the way.

misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, 
and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs 
will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could

reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these Financial Statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, 
we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit. We also:
z Identify and assess the risks of material 
misstatement of the Financial Statements, 
whether due to fraud or error, design and 
perform audit procedures responsive to 
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting 
a material misstatement resulting from 
fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control.
z Obtain an understanding of internal control 
relevant to the audit in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the internal controls of the Company and 
the Group.
z Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness 
of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by management


 Conclude on the appropriateness of 
management’s use of the going concern 
basis of accounting and, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, whether a material 
uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant 
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern. If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in our auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the Financial 
Statements or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Group to cease to continue 
as a going concern.
z Evaluate the overall presentation, structure 
and content of the Financial Statements, 
including the disclosures, and whether 
the Financial Statements represent the 
underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation.
z Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
regarding the financial information of 
the entities or business activities within 
the Group to express an opinion on the 
consolidated Financial Statements. We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision 
and performance of the group audit. We 
remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinion.
We communicate with those charged with 
governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with 
governance with a statement that we have 
complied with relevant ethical requirements 
regarding independence, and to communicate 
with them all relationships and other matters 


that may reasonably be thought to bear on 
our independence, and where applicable 
actions taken to eliminate threats or 
safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with those 
charged with governance, we determine 
those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the Financial Statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation 
precludes public disclosure about the matter 
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be 
communicated in our report because the 
adverse consequences of doing so would 
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public 
interest benefits of such communication.
Report on other legal and 
regulatory requirements
As required by section 163 (2) of the 
Companies Act No. 07 of 2007, we have 
obtained all the information and explanations 
that were required for the audit and as far 
as appears from our examination, proper 
accounting records have been kept by the 
Company and the Group.
CA Sri Lanka membership number of the

The Financial Statements of the Group and the 
Company which comprises the statement of 
financial position, statement of profit or loss 
and other comprehensive income, statement 
of changes in equity and statement of cash 
flows have been prepared in accordance 
with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards (SLFRS 
& LKAS) as laid down by The Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA 
Sri Lanka) and the requirements of the 
Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.
(b) The Financial Statements were 
authorised for issue by the Board of Directors

Directors on 15 April 2024.


(c) Basis of measurement
The Financial Statements have been prepared 
on the historical cost basis applied consistently 
except for the following item:
The liability for defined benefit obligation 
recognised is actuarially valued and recognised 
at the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation. 
(d) Functional and presentation 
currency
These Financial Statements are presented in 
Sri Lankan Rupees, which is the Company’s 
functional currency and the Group’s 
presentation currency. All financial information 
presented in rupees has been rounded to the 
nearest million, unless otherwise indicated.
(e) Use of estimates and 
judgements
The preparation of Financial Statements 
in conformity with Sri Lanka Accounting 
Standards requires management to make 
judgments, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of accounting policies 
and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to 
accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and 
in any future periods affected.
Information about significant areas of 
estimation uncertainty and critical judgments 
in applying accounting policies that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the Financial Statements is 
included in the following notes:
z Note 13 - Property, plant and equipment 
z Note 14 - Right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities
z Note 15 - Intangible assets
z Note 20 - Trade and other receivable

Note 23 - Deferred tax liabilities and 
assets
z Note 24 - Deferred income, contract 
assets and contract liabilities 
z Note 27 - Employee benefits
(f ) Current versus non-current 
classification
The Group presents assets and liabilities in 
the Statement of Financial Position based on 
current /non-current classification.
An asset is current when it is:
z Expected to be released or intended to be 
sold or consumed in the normal operating 
cycle
z Held primarily for the purpose of trading
z Expected to be realised within 12 months 
after the reporting period 
Or
z Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted 
from being exchanged or used to settle 
a liability for at least 12 months after the 
reporting period
z All other assets are classified as 
non-current.
A liability is current when:
z It is expected to be settled in the normal 
cycle
z It is held primarily for the purpose of trading
z It is due to be settled within twelve months 
after the reporting period
z There is no unconditional right to defer the 
settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the reporting period
z The terms of the liability that could, at 
the option of the counterparty, result 
in its settlement by the issue of equity 
instruments do not affect its classification
z The Group classifies all other liabilities as 
non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified 
as non-current assets and liabilities.

(g) Going concern
As at 31 December 2023, the current liabilities 
of the Company exceeded current assets by 
LKR 23,624 Mn. 
A cash flow forecast for the 12 months 
from the date of approval of the financial 
statements was prepared to assess and 
confirm the appropriateness of the going 
concern basis for the preparation of the 
financial statements of the Group. Based 
on the cash flow forecast, the Group has 
sufficient funds to fulfil its obligations for the 
next 12 months from the date of approval of 
the financial statements, with the assumption 
that the Company`s board approved 
Syndicated Term Loan of LKR 39 Bn. will be 
obtained within the next few months. As at 
the date of these financial statements, the 
Company has secured firm commitments 
from participating banks totaling LKR 39 Bn. 
and are going through the process of finalising 
the Syndicated Term Loan Agreement. The 
Group is confident of meeting the key terms 
and expects to conclude the new financing 
within the next few months.
Accordingly, these financial statements have 
been prepared on the going concern basis.
3. Significant Accounting 
Policies
The accounting policies set out below have 
been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in Financial Statements, and have 
been applied consistently by the Group 
entities, except amendments to existing 
accounting standards which are effective 
from 1 January 2023 as described in 
Note 3 (v).
(a) Basis of consolidation
(i) Business combinations
The Group accounts for business 
combinations using the acquisition method 
when control is transferred to the Group. 
The consideration transferred in acquisition 
is generally measured at fair value, as are the 
identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill
that arises is tested annually for impairment. 

Any gain or bargain purchase is recognised in 
profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs 
are expensed as incurred, except if related to 
the issue of debt or equity securities.
The consideration transferred does not 
include amounts related to the settlement 
of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts 
are generally recognised in Statement of 
Profit or Loss.
Any contingent consideration is measured 
at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an 
obligation to pay contingent consideration that 
meets the definition of a financial instrument 
is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured 
and settlement is accounted for within equity. 
Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair 
value of the contingent consideration are 
recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the 
excess of the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred and the amount recognised for 
non-controlling interests and any previous 
interest held over the net identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed). If the fair 
value of the net assets acquired is in excess of 
the aggregate consideration transferred, the 
Group re-assesses whether it has correctly 
identified all of the assets acquired and all 
of the liabilities assumed and reviews the 
procedures used to measure the amounts 
to be recognised at the acquisition date. If 
the reassessment still results in an excess of 
the fair value of net assets acquired over the 
aggregate consideration transferred, then the 
recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss. 
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured 
at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from the combination, 
irrespective of whether other assets or 
liabilities of the acquire are assigned to 
those units.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a 
cash-generating unit (CGU) and part of the 
operation within that unit is disposed of, 
the goodwill associated with the disposed 
operation is included in the carrying amount 
of the operation when determining the gain 
or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in 
these circumstances is measured based on 
the relative values of the disposed operation 
and the portion of the cash-generating 
unit retained.
(ii) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled 
by the Group. The Group controls an entity 
when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity 
and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the Consolidation of 
a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains 
control over the subsidiary and ceases when 
the Group loses control over the subsidiary.
(ii- a) Critical judgements in 
applying the entity’s accounting 
policies
The directors have concluded that the Group 
controls all subsidiaries as it has majority 
control and voting rights over its subsidiaries 
as depicted in Note (ii-b).

(iii) Equity – accounted investees 
(Investment in associates and joint 
ventures)
An associate is an entity over which the 
Group has significant influence. Significant 
influence is the power to participate in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the 
investee but is not control or joint control over 
those policies.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement 
whereby the parties that have joint control 
of the arrangement have rights to the net 
assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the 
contractually agreed sharing of control of an 
arrangement, which exists only when decisions 
about the relevant activities require unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control.
The considerations made in determining 
significant influence or joint control is similar 
to those necessary to determine control over 
subsidiaries. The Group’s investments in its 
associates and joint venture are accounted for 
using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment 
in an associate or a joint venture is initially 
recognised at cost. The carrying amount 
of the investment is adjusted to recognise 
changes in the Group’s share of net assets 
of the associate or joint venture since the 
acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the 
associate or joint venture is included in the 
carrying amount of the investment and is not 
tested for impairment separately

#!--

The Statement of profit or loss reflects the 
Group’s share of the results of operations of 
the associate or joint venture. Any change 
in other comprehensive Income of those 
investees is presented as part of the Group’s 
other comprehensive Income. In addition, 
when there has been a change recognised 
directly in the equity of the associate or joint 
venture, the Group recognises its share of any 
changes, when applicable, in the statement of 
changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses 
resulting from transactions between the 
Group and the associate or joint venture are 
eliminated to the extent of the interest in the 
associate or joint venture.
The aggregate of the Group’s share of profit 
or loss of an associate and a joint venture is 
shown on the face of the Statement of profit 
or loss outside operating profit and represents 
profit or loss after tax and non-controlling 
interests in the subsidiaries of the associate or 
joint venture.
The Financial Statements of the associate 
or joint venture are prepared for the same 
reporting period as the Group. When 
necessary, adjustments are made to bring 
the accounting policies in line with those of 
the Group.
After application of the equity method, the 
Group determines whether it is necessary 
to recognise an impairment loss on its 
investment in its associate or joint venture. At 
each reporting date, the Group determines 
whether there is objective evidence that the 
investment in the associate or joint venture is

impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group 
calculates the amount of impairment as the 
difference between the recoverable amount of 
the associate or joint venture and its carrying 
value, and then recognises the loss as ‘share of 
profit or loss of equity accounted investees’ in 
the statement of profit or loss.
Upon loss of significant influence over the 
associate or joint control over the joint 
venture, the Group measures and recognises 
any retained investment at its fair value. Any 
difference between the carrying amount of 
the associate or joint venture upon loss of 
significant influence or joint control and the fair 
value of the retained investment and proceeds 
from disposal is recognised in the statement 
of profit or loss.
(iv) Non controlling interest ( NCI)
NCI are measured at their proportionate 
share of acquiree’s identifiable net assets at 
the date of acquisition. Changes in the group 
interest in a subsidiary that do not result in 
a loss of control are accounted for as equity 
transactions. 
(v) Loss of control
When the group loses control over a subsidiary, 
it derecognises the asset and liabilities of the 
subsidiary and any related NCI (if applicable) 
and other components of equity. Any resulting 
gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any 
interest in the former subsidiary is measured 
at fair value when control is lost

(vi) Transaction eliminated on 
consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions and any 
unrealised income and expenses arising from 
intra-group transactions, are eliminated.
(b) Foreign currency
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into the respective functional 
currencies of Group companies at the 
exchange rates at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate at 
the reporting date. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities that are measured at fair value 
in a foreign currency are translated into the 
functional currency at the exchange rate 
when the fair value was determined. Foreign 
currency differences are generally recognised 
in statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income. Non-monetary items 
that are measured based on historical cost in a 
foreign currency are not translated.
(c) Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that 
gives rise to a financial asset of one entity 
and financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity.
(i) Financial assets
(i-i) Initial recognition and 
measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial 
recognition, as subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, Fair Value Through Other 
Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) and Fair 
Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL).
The classification of financial assets at initial 
recognition depends on the financial asset’s 
contractual cash flow characteristics and 
the Group’s business model for managing 
them. With the exception of trade receivables 
that do not contain a significant financing 
component or for which the Group has applied 
the practical expedient, the Group initially 
measures a financial asset at its fair value 
plus, in the case of a financial asset not at 
fair value through profit or loss, transaction 
costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a 
significant financing component or for which 
the Group has applied the practical expedient 
are measured at the transaction price as 
disclosed in Note (k) - Revenue from contracts 
with customer. 


In order for a financial asset to be classified 
and measured at amortised cost or fair value 
through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash 
flows that are ‘solely payments of principal 
and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount 
outstanding. This assessment is referred 
to as the SPPI test and is performed at an 
instrument level. Financial assets with cash 
flows that are not SPPI are classified and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
irrespective of the business model.
The Group’s business model for managing 
financial assets refers to how it manages its 
financial assets in order to generate cash flows. 
The business model determines whether cash 
flows will result from collecting contractual 
cash flows, selling the financial assets, or 
both. Financial assets are not reclassified 
subsequent to their initial recognition unless 
the Group changes its business model for 
managing financial assets, in which case all 
affected financial assets are reclassified on the 
first day of the first reporting period following 
the change in the business model. Purchases 
or sales of financial assets that require delivery 
of assets within a time frame established 
by regulation or convention in the market 
place (regular way trades) are recognised on 
the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset.
(i-ii) Subsequent measurement 
For purposes of subsequent measurement, 
financial assets are classified in four 
categories;
z Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
z Financial assets at fair value through OCI 
with recycling of cumulative gains and 
losses (debt instruments)
z Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI with no recycling of cumulative 
gains and losses upon derecognition (equity 
instruments)
z Financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss
Financial assets at amortised cost (debt 
instruments)
The Group measures financial assets at 
amortised cost if both following conditions 
are met:
z The financial asset is held within a business 
model with the objective to hold financial 
assets in order to collect contractual cash 
flows, and
z The contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding

Financial assets at amortised cost are 
subsequently measured using the effective 
interest rate (EIR) method and are subject to 
impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in 
profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, 
modified or impaired.
The Group’s financial assets at amortised cost 
include trade and other receivables, amounts 
due from related parties and cash and cash 
equivalents.
Financial assets at fair value through 
OCI (debt instruments)
The Group measures debt instruments at 
fair value through OCI if both of following 
conditions are met:
z The financial asset is held within a business 
model with the objective of both holding to 
collect contractual cash flows and selling, 
and
z The contractual terms of the financial 
asset give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding.
For debt instruments at fair value through 
OCI, interest income, foreign exchange 
revaluation and impairment losses or reversals 
are recognised in the statement of profit or 
loss and computed in the same manner as 
for financial assets measured at amortised 
cost. The remaining fair value changes are 
recognised in OCI. Upon derecognition, the 
cumulative fair value change recognised in OCI 
is recycled to profit or loss.
Financial assets designated at fair value 
through OCI (equity instruments)
Upon initial recognition, the Group can elect 
to classify irrevocably its equity investments 
as equity instruments designated at fair value 
through OCI when they meet the definition of 
equity under LKAS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation and are not held for trading. The 
classification is determined on an instrument by-instrument basis.
Gains and losses on these financial assets are 
never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are 
recognised as other income in the statement 
of profit or loss when the right of payment 
has been established, except when the Group 
benefits from such proceeds as a recovery 
of part of the cost of the financial asset, in 
which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. 
Equity instruments designated at fair value 
through OCI are not subject to impairment 
assessment


This category includes listed and non listed 
equity instruments that the Group elected to 
classify irrevocably.
Financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss include financial assets held for trading, 
financial assets designated upon initial 
recognition at fair value through profit or loss, 
or financial assets mandatorily required to 
be measured at fair value. Financial assets 
are classified as held for trading if they 
are acquired for the purpose of selling or 
repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives, 
including separated embedded derivatives, 
are also classified as held for trading unless 
they are designated as effective hedging 
instruments. Financial assets with cash flows 
that are not solely payments of principal and 
interest are classified and measured at fair 
value through profit or loss, irrespective of 
the business model. Notwithstanding the 
criteria for debt instruments to be classified 
at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI, 
as described above, debt instruments may be 
designated at fair value through profit or loss 
on initial recognition if doing so eliminates, or 
significantly reduces, an accounting mismatch.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss are carried in the statement of financial 
position at fair value with net changes in fair 
value recognised in the statement of profit 
or loss.
This category includes derivative instruments 
and listed equity investments which the Group 
had not irrevocably elected to classify at fair 
value through OCI. Dividends on listed equity 
investments are also recognised as other 
income in the statement of profit or loss when 
the right of payment has been established.
A derivative embedded in a hybrid contract, 
with a financial liability or non-financial host, 
is separated from the host and accounted 
for as a separate derivative if: the economic 
characteristics and risks are not closely related 
to the host; a separate instrument with the 
same terms as the embedded derivative would 
meet the definition of a derivative; and the 
hybrid contract is not measured at fair value 
through profit or loss. Embedded derivatives 
are measured at fair value with changes 
in fair value recognised in profit or loss. 
Reassessment only occurs if there is either 
a change in the terms of the contract that 
significantly modifies the cash flows that would 
otherwise be required or a reclassification of 
a financial asset out of the fair value through 
profit or loss category


(i-iii) Fair value measurement
SLFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that 
would be received to sell and asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transactions 
between market participants at the 
measurement date.
 A fair value measurement requires an entity to 
determine all the following;
1. The particular asset or liability that is the 
subject of the measurement.
2. For a non-financial asset, the valuation 
premise that is appropriate for the 
measurement (consistently with its highest 
and best use).
3. The principal (or most advantageous) 
market for the asset or liability.
4. The valuation technique(s) appropriate 
for the measurement, considering the 
availability of data with which to develop 
inputs that represent the assumptions that 
market participants would use when pricing 
the asset or liability and the level of the fair 
value hierarchy within which the inputs are 
categorised.
5. Fair value is a market-based measurement, 
not an entity-specific measurement. For 
some assets and liabilities, observable 
market transactions or market.
When transaction price provides the best 
evidence of fair value at initial recognition, 
the financial instrument is initially measured 
at the transaction price and any difference 
between this price and the value initially 
obtained from a valuation model is 
subsequently recognised in profit or loss 
on an appropriate basis over the life of the 
instrument but not later than when the 
valuation is supported wholly by observable 
market data or the transaction is closed out.
Determination of fair values
The determination of fair value for financial 
assets and liabilities for which there is no 
observable market price requires the use of 
valuation techniques. For financial instruments 
that trade infrequently and have little price 
transparency, fair value is less objective 
and requires varying degrees of judgment 
depending on liquidity, concentration, 
uncertainty of market factors, pricing 
assumption and other risks affecting the 
specific instrument.
– Level 1 - fair value measurements using 
quoted prices (unadjusted) in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities;
– Level 2 - fair value measurements using 
inputs other than quoted prices included 
within level 1 that are observable for the

asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as 
prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from 
prices);and
– Level 3 - fair value measurements using 
inputs for the asset or liability that are not 
based on observable market data (i.e., 
unobservable inputs).
(i-iv) Amortised cost
The amortised cost of a financial asset or 
liability is the amount at which the financial 
asset or liability is measured at initial 
recognition, minus principal repayments, 
plus or minus the cumulative amortisation 
using the effective interest method of 
any difference between the initial amount 
recognised and the maturity amount, minus 
any reduction for impairment.
(i-v) Impairment
Non-derivative financial assets
Financial assets not classified at fair value 
through profit or loss, are assessed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is 
objective evidence of impairment.
Objective evidence that financial assets are 
impaired includes;
– default or delinquency by a debtor;
– restructuring of an amount due to the 
Group on terms that the Group would not 
consider otherwise;
– indications that a debtor or issuer will enter 
bankruptcy;
– adverse changes in the payment status of 
borrowers or issuers;
– the disappearance of an active market for a 
security; or
– Observable data indicating that there is a 
measurable decrease in the expected cash 
flows from a group of financial assets.
In addition, for an investment in an equity 
security, a significant or prolonged decline in its 
fair value below its cost is objective evidence 
of impairment.
For trade receivables and contract assets, 
the Group applies a simplified approach in 
calculating Expected Credit Losses (ECLs). 
Therefore, the Group does not track changes 
in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss 
allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each 
reporting date. The Group has established a 
provision matrix that is based on its historical 
credit loss experience, adjusted for forward 
looking factors specific to the debtors and the 
economic environment


The Group considers a financial asset in default 
when contractual payments are 90 days past 
due. However, in certain cases, the Group may 
also consider a financial asset to be in default 
when internal or external information indicates 
that the Group is unlikely to receive the 
outstanding contractual amounts in full before 
taking into account any credit enhancements 
held by the Group. A financial asset is written 
off when there is no reasonable expectation of 
recovering the contractual cash flows.
Investments in fixed deposits ,Treasury Bills 
and Bonds are considered as low risk of default.
Non-financial assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the 
carrying amounts of its non-financial assets 
(other than investment property, inventories 
and deferred tax assets) to determine whether 
there is any indication of impairment. If 
any such indication exists, then the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is 
tested annually for impairment.
For impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets 
that generates cash inflows from continuing 
use that are largely independent of the cash 
inflows of other assets or CGUs.
Goodwill arising from a business combination 
is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs that 
are expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the combination.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is 
the greater of its value in use and its fair value 
less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the 
estimated future cash flows, discounted to 
their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reflects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset or CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised if the 
carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds 
its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or 
loss . They are allocated first to reduce the 
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying 
amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a 
pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not 
reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss 
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying 
amount that would have been determined, 
net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.

i-vi) Hedge
For designated and qualifying cash flow 
hedges, the effective portion of the gain or 
loss on the hedging instrument is initially 
recognised directly in equity in the “cash flow 
hedge reserve”. The ineffective portion of 
the gains or losses on the hedge instrument 
is recognised immediately in the profit 
and loss.
When the hedge cash flow affect the Income 
Statement, the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recorded in the corresponding 
income or expense line of the Income 
Statement. When a hedging instrument 
expires, or is sold, terminated, exercised or 
when a hedge no longer meet the criteria 
for hedge accounting, any cumulative gains/
losses existing in other comprehensive 
income at that time remains in other 
comprehensive income and is recognised 
in the income statement. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur 
the cumulative gains/loss was reported in 
other comprehensive income is immediately 
transferred to the Income Statement.
(ii) Financial liabilities
(ii-i) Initial recognition and 
measurement
Financial Liabilities are classified, at initial 
recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, 
payables, or as appropriate. 
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at 
fair value and , in the case of loans, borrowings, 
vendor financing and payables, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs.
The Group’s financial liabilities include trade 
and other payables, loans and borrowings 
including bank overdrafts, vendor financing, 
lease liabilities, contract liabilities and 
deferred income.
(ii-ii)Subsequent measurement
This is the category most relevant to the 
Group. After initial recognition, interestbearing loans and borrowings and vendor 
financing are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the EIR method, after 
considering any discount or premium on 
acquisition and fees or costs that are an 
integral part of the EIR. Gains and losses are 
recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities 
are derecognised. EIR amortisation is 
included as finance costs in the statement 
of profit or loss

(ii-iii) Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the 
obligation under the liability is discharged 
or cancelled or expires. When an existing 
financial liability is replaced by another from 
the same lender on substantially different 
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are 
substantially modified, such an exchange or 
modification is treated as the derecognition 
of the original liability and the recognition 
of a new liability. The difference in the 
respective carrying amounts is recognised 
in the statement of profit or loss.
(iii) Offsetting of financial 
instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
offset and the net amount is reported in the 
consolidated statement of financial position 
if there is a currently enforceable legal right to 
offset the recognised amounts and there is an 
intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the 
assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment 
are measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated 
impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly 
attributable to the acquisition of the asset. 
The cost of self-constructed assets includes 
the cost of materials and direct labour and any 
other costs directly attributable to bringing the 
assets to a working condition for their intended 
use. Purchased software that is integral to 
the functionality of the related equipment is 
capitalised as part of that asset.
When parts of an item of property, plant 
and equipment have different useful lives, 
they are accounted for as separate items 
(major components) of property, plant 
and equipment.
(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing part of an item of 
property, plant and equipment is recognised 
in the carrying amount of the item if it is 
probable that the future economic benefits 
embodied within the part will flow to the 
Group and its cost can be measured reliably. 
The costs of the day-to-day servicing 
of property, plant and equipment are 
recognised in profit or loss.


(iii) Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable 
amount, which is the cost of an asset, or other 
amount substituted for cost, less its residual 
value. Depreciation is recognised in profit or 
loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful lives of each part of an item of property, 
plant and equipment. In the year of acquisition 
depreciation is computed on proportionate 
basis from the month the asset is put into 
use and no depreciation will be charged to 
the month in which the particular asset was 
disposed. Leased assets are depreciated over 
the shorter of the lease term and their useful 
lives unless it is reasonably certain that the 
Group will obtain ownership by the end of the 
lease term. Land is not depreciated.
Depreciation method, useful lives and residual 
values are reviewed at each reporting date and 
adjusted if appropriate.
The estimated useful lives for the assets are 
as follows:

Freehold buildings 5 - 40 years
Submarine cables 10 - 25 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
CDMA handsets 3 years
PABX System 1-6 years
IT Systems 5 - 10 years
Other fixed assets 2 - 12.5 years
Network equipment
Ducts, cables and other 
outside plant 4 - 20 years
Telephone exchanges and 
transmission equipment 5 -12.5 years
Towers 40 years

(iv) Capital work-in-progress
Capital work-in-progress is stated at cost 
net of accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
These are expenses of a capital nature directly 
incurred in the construction of buildings, 
network equipment, system development and 
other fixed assets, awaiting capitalisation.
Major spare parts and project related inventory 
qualify as property, plant and equipment 
when the entity expects to use them during 
more than one year period and are used in 
connection with specific items of property, 
plant and equipment.
(v) Derecognition
“The carrying amount of an item of property, 
plant & equipment is derecognised on disposal. 
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of 

#!--

property, plant and equipment are determined 
by comparing the proceeds from disposal 
with the carrying amount of property, plant 
and equipment and are recognised net within 
“other income” in the statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive Income.
When replacement costs are recognised in 
the carrying amount of an item of property, 
plant and equipment, the remaining carrying 
amount of the replaced part is derecognised. 
Major inspection costs are capitalised. At each 
such capitalisation, the remaining carrying 
amount of the previous cost of inspections is 
derecognised.
(vi) Borrowing cost
Borrowing cost directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of 
a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a 
substantial period of time to get ready for 
its intended use or sale are capitalised as 
part of the cost of the respective assets. All 
other borrowing costs are expensed in the 
period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of 
interest and other costs that an entity incurs in 
connection with the borrowing of funds.
(e) Intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries.
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of 
subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. For 
measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, 
see Note 3 (a) (i)
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired 
by the Group, which have finite useful lives, 
are measured at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses.
(iii) Licenses
Separately acquired licenses are shown at 
historical cost. Expenditures on license fees 
that is deemed to benefit or relate to more 
than one financial year is classified as license 
fee and is being amortised over the License 
period on a straight line basis.

(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only 
when it increases the future economic 
benefits embodied in the specific asset to 
which it relates. All other expenditure, including 
expenditure on internally generated goodwill is 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
The estimated useful lives for the intangible 
assets are as follows:
Licences 2 - 10 years
Software 1-10 years
Others 5 years
(f ) Right-of-use assets and lease 
liabilities
Leases
The Group assesses at contract inception 
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That 
is, if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of 
time in exchange for consideration.
Group as a lessee
The Group applies a single recognition and 
measurement approach for all leases, except 
for short-term leases and leases of low-value 
assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities 
to make lease payments and right-of-use 
assets representing the right to use the 
underlying assets.
Right-of-use assets 
The Group recognises right-of-use assets at 
the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the 
date the underlying asset is available for use). 
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less 
any accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement 
of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use 
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities 
recognised, initial direct costs incurred, 
and lease payments made at or before the 
commencement date less any lease incentives 
received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the 
lease term and the estimated useful lives of 
the assets, as follows:

Leased assets Estimated 
useful lives
Buildings 2-5 years
Towers 2-5 years


If ownership of the leased asset transfers 
to the Group at the end of the lease term or 
the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase 
option, depreciation is calculated using the 
estimated useful life of the asset. The rightof-use assets are also subject to impairment 
as more fully described In Note (U) (ii) - 
Impairment of Assets.
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the 
Group recognises lease liabilities measured 
at the present value of lease payments to 
be made over the lease term. The lease 
payments include fixed payments (including 
in-substance fixed payments) less any 
lease incentives receivable, variable lease 
payments that depend on an index or a rate, 
and amounts expected to be paid under 
residual value guarantees. The lease payments 
also include the exercise price of a purchase 
option reasonably certain to be exercised 
by the Group and payments of penalties 
for terminating the lease, if the lease term 
reflects the Group exercising the option to 
terminate. Variable lease payments that do not 
depend on an index or a rate are recognised as 
expenses (unless they are incurred to produce 
inventories) in the period in which the event or 
condition that triggers the payment occur.
In calculating the present value of lease 
payments, the Group uses its incremental 
borrowing rate at the lease commencement 
date because the interest rate implicit in the 
lease is not readily determinable. After the 
commencement date, the amount of lease 
liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of 
interest and reduced for the lease payments 
made. In addition, the carrying amount of 
lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a 
modification, a change in the lease term, a 
change in the lease payments (e.g., changes 
to future payments resulting from a change in 
an index or rate used to determine such lease 
payments) or a change in the assessment of 
an option to purchase the underlying asset.
The Group’s lease liabilities are included in 
rights-of-use assets and lease liabilities in 
Note 14 to the Financial Statements.
Leases of low-value assets 
The Group applies the lease of low-value 
assets recognition exemption to leases of 
some tower rentals that are considered to 
be low value. Lease payments on leases 
of low-value assets are recognised as 
expenses on straight-line basis over the 
lease term. 


Group as a lessor 
Leases in which the Group does not transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership of an asset are classified as 
operating leases. Rental income arising is 
accounted for on a straight-line basis over 
the lease terms and is included in revenue 
in the statement of profit or loss due to its 
operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in 
negotiating and arranging an operating lease 
are added to the carrying amount of the leased 
asset and recognised over the lease term on 
the same basis as rental income. Contingent 
rents are recognised as revenue in the period 
in which they are earned.
(g) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. The cost of 
inventories is based on the weighted average 
cost principle. Value of inventories includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring, conversion 
costs and other costs incurred in bringing 
them to their existing location and condition.
(h) Share capital
Ordinary share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the 
issue of ordinary shares and share options are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net of 
any tax effects.
(i) Government grants
Government grants are recognised initially at 
fair value when there is reasonable assurance 
that they will be received and the Group 
will comply with the conditions associated 
with the grant. Grants that compensate the 
Group for expenses incurred are recognised 
in the statement of Profit or Loss and Other 
Comprehensive Income as other income 
on a systematic basis in the same periods in 
which the expenses are recognised. Grants 
that compensate the Group for the cost of 
an asset are recognised in the of profit or loss 
on a systematic basis over the useful life of 
the asset. 
(j) Employee benefits
(i) Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a postemployment benefit plan under which 
contributions are made into a separate 
fund and the entity will have no legal or 
constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. Obligations for contributions to 
defined contribution plan are recognised 
as an employee benefit expense in profit 
or loss in the periods during which services

are rendered by employees. Prepaid 
contributions are recognised as an asset to 
the extent that a cash refund or a reduction 
in future payments is available. 
Employees’ Provident Fund
All employees of the Company are members 
of the Sri Lanka Telecom Provident Fund to 
which the Company contributes 15% of such 
employees’ basic salary and allowances. 
All employees of subsidiaries of the Group 
are members of Employees’ Provident Fund 
(EPF), to which the respective subsidiaries 
contribute 12% of such employees’ basic 
salary and allowances. Employees of 
Sri Lanka Telecom (Services) Limited are 
members of Employees’ Provident Fund 
(EPF), where the company contribute 
15% of such employees’ basic salary 
and allowances.
Employees’ Trust Fund
The Company and other subsidiaries 
contribute 3% of the salary of each employee 
to the Employees’ Trust Fund. 
(ii) Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a post-employment 
benefit plan other than a defined contribution 
plan. The defined benefit is calculated by an 
independent actuary using Projected Unit 
Credit method as recommended by LKAS 19 
“Employee Benefits” The present value of 
the defined benefit obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows using the yield on Government Bonds 
at the reporting date and have maturity dates 
approximating to the terms of the Company’s 
obligations.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and 
losses that arise in calculating the Group’s 
obligation in respect of a plan in other 
comprehensive income. 
The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation depends on a number of factors 
that are determined on an actuarial basis using 
a number of assumptions. Key assumptions 
used in determining the defined retirement 
benefit obligations are given in Note 26. Any 
changes in these assumptions will impact the 
carrying amount of defined benefit obligations.
Provision has been made for retirement 
gratuities from the first year of service 
for all employees, in conformity with 
LKAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. However, 
under the Payment of Gratuity Act No.12 
of 1983, the liability to an employee 
arises only on completion of five years of 
continued service.

iii) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are recognised as an 
expense when the Group is demonstrably 
committed, without realistic possibility of 
withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either 
terminate employment before the normal 
retirement date, or to provide termination 
benefits as a result of an offer made to 
encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination 
benefits for voluntary redundancies are 
recognised as an expense if the Group has 
made an offer of voluntary redundancy, it 
is probable that the offer will be accepted, 
and the number of acceptances can be 
estimated reliably.
(iv) Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are 
measured on an undiscounted basis and are 
expensed as the related service is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount 
expected to be paid under short-term cash 
bonus or leave encashment plans if the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation 
to pay this amount as a result of past service 
provided by the employee and the obligation 
can be estimated reliably.
(k) Revenue from contracts with 
customers
“The Group is primarily involved in providing a 
broad portfolio of telecommunication services 
across Sri Lanka. In addition, the range of 
services provided by the Group include, inter 
alia, voice and broadband services, domestic 
and international leased circuits, broadband, 
satellite up-link, maritime transmission, IPTV 
service, directory publishing service and 
educational services.
Revenue from contracts with customers is 
recognised when control of the goods or 
services are transferred to the customer at 
an amount that reflects the consideration 
to which the Group expects to be entitled in 
exchange for those goods or services. The 
Group has generally concluded that it is the 
principal in its revenue arrangements.
(i) Performance obligations relevant 
to contracts
As a telecommunication service provider, 
the Group’s performance obligation related 
to service contracts include the installation 
services and maintenance services provided 
and the uninterrupted telecommunication 
service which will be provided throughout the 
connection period.
The Group expects that above performance 
obligations would be satisfied throughout the 
connection period

Domestic and international call revenue 
and rental income 
Fixed lines
Revenue for call time usage by customers 
is recognised as revenue as services are 
performed on accrual basis. Fixed rental is 
recognised as income on a monthly basis in 
relation to the period of services rendered.
Mobile Revenue
Mobile revenue comprises amounts charged 
to customers in respect of monthly access 
charges, airtime usage, messaging, and the 
provision of other mobile telecommunications 
services. Mobile monthly access charges are 
invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic 
billing cycle. Air time, either from contract 
customers as part of the invoiced amount or 
from prepaid customers through the sale of 
prepaid cards, is recorded in the period in which 
the customer uses the service.
Revenue from other network operators 
and international settlements
The revenue received from other network 
operators, local and international, for the use 
of the Group’s telecommunication network 
are recognised, net of taxes, based on usage 
taking the traffic minutes/per second rates 
stipulated in the relevant agreements and 
regulations and based on the terms of the 
lease agreements for fixed rentals. 
Revenue arising from the interconnection 
of voice and data traffic between other 
telecommunications operators is recognised 
at the time of transit across the Group’s 
network and presented on gross basis. The 
relevant revenue accrued is recognised 
under income in the Income Statement and 
interconnection expenses recognised under 
operating costs in profit or loss.
Revenue from broadband
Revenue from Data services and IPTV services 
is recognised on usage and the fixed rental on 
a monthly basis when it is earned net of taxes, 
rebates and discounts.
Revenue from other ICT services
The revenue from other telephone services 
are recognised on an accrual basis based on 
fixed rental contracts entered between the 
Group and subscribers.
Recognition of deferred income
The connection fees relating to Public Switch 
Telephone Network (PSTN) are deferred over a 
period of 15 years. LKR revenue is recognised 
on an annual basis irrespective of the date 
of connection.


IRU revenue relating to leasing of SEA-ME-WE 
4 cable capacity are recognised on a straight 
line basis over the period of the contracts. 
Amounts received in advance for any services 
are recorded as deferred revenue. In the event 
that a customer terminates an IRU prior to 
the expiry of the contract and releases the 
Company from the obligation to provide future 
services, the remaining unamortised deferred 
revenue is recognised in the period the 
contract is terminated.
Backhauling revenue which is leasing of 
SEA-ME-WE 3 cable capacity is recognised 
on a straight line basis over the period of 
contracts. Amounts received in advance for 
any services are recorded as deferred revenue.
Revenue from the sale of prepaid CDMA cards 
is deferred until such time as the customer 
uses the call time, downloadable quota or the 
credit expires.
Sale of mobile recharge cards and reloads for 
prepaid subscribers are initially recognised 
as deferred revenue until such time as 
the subscribers use the services or credit 
period expires.
(ii) New connection fees
The Group provides installation services 
relevant to the new connections of fixed and 
mobile telecommunication services including 
both voice and non-voice categories. These 
installation services are bundled together 
with providing of Customer Premises 
Equipment (CPE) to customers in fixed line 
voice and some non-voice services. When 
the performance obligations relevant to such 
installation services are performed, CPEs 
provided to customers are considered as 
assets of the Group as long as the contracts 
with customers are valid. Accordingly, the 
Group allocates a bundled price for the 
equipment and installation services for 
such facilities.
(iii) Recognition of contract 
liabilities
“The Group concluded that revenue from 
new connections in fixed and mobile 
telecommunication services is to be 
recognised over time because the customer 
simultaneously receives and consumes 
the benefits provided by the Group. The 
fact that another entity would not need to 
reperform the installation of the service that 
the Group has provided to date demonstrates 
that the customer simultaneously receives 
and consumes the benefits of the Group’s 
performance as it performs

The Group identifies the revenue for 
installation services as a contract liability and 
recognises the revenue on a systematic basis 
that is consistent with the entity’s transfer of 
the related goods or services to the customer 
since satisfaction for the installation services 
will be consumed by the customer over the 
contract period.
(iv) Costs incurred in securing 
customer contracts
The Group identifies the sales commission 
paid to sales team for each new connection 
contract and other such related costs in 
contract acquisition as costs incurred in 
securing customer contracts.
(v) Recognition of contract 
assets
Contract acquisition costs are recognised as a 
contract asset and subsequently recognised 
as an expense over the life of a contract 
on a systematic basis consistent with the 
pattern of the transfer of services to which 
the asset relates, that is; as and when the 
relevant performance obligation is fulfilled for a 
given month.
(l) Expenditure
The expenses are recognised on an accrual 
basis. All expenses incurred in the ordinary 
course of business and in maintaining property, 
plant and equipment in a state of efficiency is 
charged against income in arriving at the profit 
for the year.
(m) Lease payments 
Minimum lease payments made under finance 
leases are apportioned between the finance 
expense and the reduction of the outstanding 
liability. The finance expense is allocated to 
each period during the lease term so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on 
the remaining balance of the liability. 
Contingent lease payments are accounted for 
by revising the minimum lease payments over 
the remaining term of the lease when the lease 
adjustment is confirmed. Determining whether 
an arrangement contains a lease.
At inception of an arrangement, the Group 
determines whether such an arrangement is or 
contains a lease. A specific asset is the subject 
of a lease if fulfillment of the arrangement 
is dependent on the use of that specific 
asset. An arrangement conveys the right to 
use the asset if the arrangement conveys to 
the Group the right to control the use of the 
underlying asset.

(n) Finance income and expenses
The Group’s finance income and finance 
cost include:
z Interest income from repurchase 
agreements
z Interest income from fixed deposits
z Staff loan interest income
z Interest expense from borrowings
z Interest expense arising from Leases
z Foreign exchange gains or losses
Interest income or expense is recognised 
using the effective interest method. Dividend 
income is recognised in profit or loss on the 
date on which the Group’s right to receive 
payment is established.
(o) Income tax
Current income tax assets are measured at 
amount to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities
(i) Current taxation
Income tax expense comprises current 
and deferred tax. Income tax expense is 
recognised or profit or loss except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity, in which case it is recognised 
in equity or other comprehensive income.
Provisions for taxation is based on the profit 
for the year adjusted for taxation purposes 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 and the 
amendments thereto.
(ii) Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of 
temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used 
for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not 
recognised for the following temporary 
differences; 
– The initial recognition of assets or liabilities 
in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and that affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss and 
differences relating to investments in 
nor taxable profit or loss and differences 
relating to investments in subsidiaries to 
the extent that it is probable that they will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future.
– Deferred tax is not recognised for taxable 
temporary differences arising on the initial 
recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, based on the 
laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are offset if there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax 
liabilities and assets, and they relate to income 
taxes levied by the same tax authority on the 
same taxable entity or on different tax entities, 
but they intend to settle current tax liabilities 
and assets on a net basis or their tax assets 
liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the 
extent that it is probable that future taxable 
profits will be available against which the 
temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred 
tax is not recognised for the undistributed 
profits of subsidiaries as the Parent Company 
has control over the dividend policy of its 
subsidiaries and distribution of those profits. 
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date and are reduced to the extent 
that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised 
outside profit or loss, is recognised either in 
other comprehensive income or directly in 
Statement of Changes in Equity in line with the 
underlying transaction.
(iii) Social Security Contribution 
Levy (SSCL)
According to the Social Security Contribution 
Levy Act No. 25 of 2022, Sri Lanka Telecom 
PLC is liable for Social Security Contribution 
Levy at 2.5% on the liable turnover arising 
from providing of a service with effect from 
01 October 2022.
(iv) Sales tax
Revenue, expenses and assets are 
recognised net of the amount of sales 
tax, except: where sales tax incurred on 
a purchase of assets or services is not 
recoverable from the taxation authority, in 
which case the sales tax is recognised as 
part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or 
as part of expense item as applicable.
(v) Uncertainty over income tax 
treatment
The Group determines whether to consider 
each uncertain tax treatment separately or 
together with one or more other uncertain tax 
treatments and uses the approach that better 
predicts the resolution of the uncertainty

The Group applies significant judgment 
in identifying uncertainties over income 
tax treatments and it assessed whether 
the interpretation had an impact on its 
consolidated Financial Statements.
If the Group concludes that it is probable 
that the taxation authority will accept the tax 
treatment used or planned to be used in its tax 
fillings, the entity determines its tax position 
on that basis. This is consistent with the 
requirement that current tax is measured at 
the amount expected to be paid or recovered 
from the taxation authorities, and that 
deferred tax is measured using the rates and 
tax laws expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or liability is settled.
If the Group concludes that acceptance of 
the uncertain tax treatment by the taxation 
authorities is not probable, it would apply one 
of the following two methods for reflecting 
the effect of uncertainty in its estimate of the 
amount it expects to pay or recover from the 
tax authorities
a. the most likely amount - the single most 
likely amount in a range of possible 
outcomes; or
b. the expected value - the sum of the 
probability-weighted amounts in a range 
of possible outcomes.
The Group uses the method that is expects 
to better predict the resolution of the 
uncertainty.
(p) Earnings Per Share 
The Group presents basic Earnings Per Share 
(EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS 
is calculated by dividing the profit or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the 
company by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting 
the profit or loss attributable to ordinary 
shareholders and the weighted-average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding for the 
effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
(q) Insurance reserve
SLT has Property All Risk Insurance for 
targeted assets of the SLT at island wide 
locations. In order to cover the exposure 
of remaining assets and possible further 
exposure LKR 300 Million has been retained 
in the insurance reserve. There are no further 
contributions to the insurance fund due to the 
reason of annual renewal of Property All Risk 
policy of SLT

(r) Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s 
shareholders is recognised as a liability in the 
Group’s Financial Statements in the period 
in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders.
Provision for final dividends is recognised at 
the time the dividend recommended and 
declared by the Board of Directors, is approved 
by the shareholders.
(s) Comparatives
Except when a standard permits or requires 
otherwise, comparative information is 
disclosed in respect of the previous period. 
Where the presentation or classification 
of items in the Financial Statements are 
amended, comparative amounts are 
reclassified unless it is impracticable.
(t) Statement of cash flows
The Statement of Cash Flows has been 
prepared using the ‘indirect method’ of 
preparing cash flows in accordance with the 
Sri Lanka Accounting Standard (LKAS 07) – 
“Statement of Cash Flows”. Cash and Cash 
equivalents comprise short-term, highly liquid 
investments that are readily convertible to 
known amounts of cash and are subject to 
an insignificant risk of change in value. The 
cash and cash equivalent include cash in hand, 
balances with banks, placements with banks, 
money at call and short notice.
(u) Critical accounting estimates, 
assumptions and judgements
In the preparation of these Financial 
Statements, a number of estimates and 
assumptions have been made relating to the 
performance and the financial position of the 
Group. Results may differ significantly from 
those estimates under different assumptions 
and conditions. The Directors consider 
that the following discussion addresses the 
Company’s most critical accounting policies, 
which are those that are most important to 
the presentation of its financial performance 
and position. These particular policies require 
subjective and complex judgements, often as 
a result of the need to make estimates about 
the effect of matters that are uncertain.
(i) Depreciation of property, plant 
and equipment
The Company assigns useful lives and residual 
values to property, plant and equipment based 
on periodic studies of actual asset lives and 
the intended use for those assets. Changes
in circumstances such as technological

advances, prospective economic utilisation 
and physical condition of the assets concerned 
could result in the actual useful lives or residual 
values differing from initial estimates.
Where the Company determines that the 
useful life of property, plant and equipment 
should be shortened or residual value 
reduced, it depreciates the net carrying 
amount in excess of the residual value over 
the revised remaining useful life, thereby 
increasing depreciation expense. Any 
change in an asset’s life or residual value 
is reflected in the Company’s Financial 
Statements when the change in estimate 
is determined.
(ii) Impairment of property, plant 
and equipment and intangible 
assets
The Company assesses the impairment of 
property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable or otherwise 
as required by accounting standards. Factors 
that are considered important and which 
could trigger an impairment review include 
the following;
a. obsolescence or physical damage;
b. significant changes in technology and 
regulatory environments;
c. significant underperformance relative to 
expected historical or projected future 
operating results;
d. significant changes in the use of its assets 
or the strategy for its overall business;
The identification of impairment indicators, 
the estimation of future cash flows and the 
determination of the recoverable amount 
for assets or cash generating units require 
significant judgement.
(iii) Revenue recognition
Judgement is required in assessing the 
application of the principles of revenue 
recognition in respect of revenues. This 
includes presentation of revenue as principal 
or as agent in respect of income received 
from transmission of content provided by 
third parties.
(iv) Valuation of receivables 
The provision for impairment losses for trade 
and other receivables reflects the Company’s 
estimates of losses arising from the failure 
or inability of customers to make required 
payments. The provision is based on the 
ageing of customer accounts, customer

credit-worthiness and the Company’s 
historical write-off experience etc. Changes 
to the provision may be required if the 
financial condition of its customers improves 
or deteriorates. An improvement in financial 
condition may result in lower actual write-offs.
(v) Inventories
The Company assesses the inventory 
provision whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable or otherwise 
as required by accounting standards. Factors 
that are considered important and which 
could trigger an impairment review include 
the following;
a. obsolescence or physical damage;
b. significant changes in technology and 
regulatory environments;
c. significant changes in the use of its assets 
or the strategy for its overall business;
(vi) Current tax and deferred tax
Judgement was required to determine the 
total provision for current, deferred and 
other taxes due to uncertainties that exist 
with respect to the interpretation of the 
applicability of tax law at the time of the 
preparation of these Financial Statements.
Certain uncertainties exist with respect to 
the interpretation of tax regulations and 
the amount and timing of future taxable 
income. Differences arising between the 
actual results and the assumptions made, or 
future changes to such assumptions, could 
necessitate future adjustments to tax income 
and expense already recorded. Where the 
final tax outcome of such matters is different 
from the amounts that were initially recorded, 
such differences will impact the income and 
deferred tax amounts in the period in which 
the determination is made.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to be applied to temporary 
differences when they reverse, based on the 
laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date.
(vii) Leases-Estimating the 
incremental borrowing rate
“The Group cannot readily determine the 
interest rate implicit in the lease, therefore, it 
uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to 
measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate of 
interest that the Group would have to pay to 
borrow over a similar term, and with a similar 
security, the funds necessary to obtain an 
asset of a similar value to the right-of-use 
asset in a similar economic environment. 

The IBR therefore reflects what the Group 
“would have to pay”, which requires estimation 
when no observable rates are available or 
when they need to be adjusted to reflect the 
terms and conditions of the lease. The Group 
estimates the IBR using observable inputs 
such as market interest rates when available 
and is required to make certain entity-specific 
estimates as well.
(viii) Revenue recognition from 
contracts with customers
Judgement is required in assessing the 
application of the principles of revenue 
recognition in respect of revenues. 
Certain contracts with customers are 
bundled packages that may include sale 
of products and telecommunications 
services that comprise voice, data, and 
other telecommunications services. The 
Group accounts for individual products 
and services separately as separate 
performance obligations if they are distinct 
promised goods and services. The Group 
exercises judgements in determining 
whether a product is distinct, that is, if such 
product or service is separately identifiable 
from other items in the bundled package 
and if a customer can benefit from it 
separately. This determination will affect the 
allocation of consideration specified in the 
contract and the revenue recognised for 
each performance obligation.
(v) Amendments to existing 
accounting standards
The Group applied for the first-time certain 
standards and amendments, which are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or 
after 1 January 2023. The Group has not early 
adopted any other standard, interpretation or 
amendment that has been issued but is not 
yet effective.
Definition of accounting estimates – 
Amendments to LKAS 8
The amendments to LKAS 8 clarify the 
distinction between changes in accounting 
estimates, changes in accounting policies 
and the correction of errors. They also 
clarify how entities use measurement 
techniques and inputs to develop 
accounting estimates. The amendments 
had no impact on the Group’s consolidated 
Financial Statements

#!--

Amendments to LKAS 1: Classification 
of liabilities as current or non-current
Amendments to LKAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements specify the requirements 
for classifying liabilities as current or 
non-current. The amendments clarify;
z What is meant by a right to defer settlement
z That a right to defer must exist at the end of 
the reporting period
z That classification is unaffected by the 
likelihood that an entity will exercise its 
deferral right
z That only if an embedded derivative in 
a convertible liability is itself an equity 
instrument would the terms of a liability not 
impact its classification
z Disclosure
The amendments had no impact on the 
Group’s consolidated Financial Statements.
Disclosure of accounting policies – 
Amendments to LKAS 1 and SLFRS 
Practice Statement 2
The amendments to LKAS 1 and SLFRS 
Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality 
Judgements provide guidance and examples 
to help entities apply materiality judgements to 
accounting policy disclosures.
The amendments aim to help entities provide 
accounting policy disclosures that are more 
useful by replacing the requirement for entities 
to disclose their ‘significant’ accounting 
policies with a requirement to disclose their 
‘material’ accounting policies and adding 
guidance on how entities apply the concept 
of materiality in making decisions about 
accounting policy disclosures.
“The amendments have had an impact 
on the Group’s disclosures of accounting 
policies, but not on the measurement, 
recognition or presentation of any items in 
the Group’s Financial Statements.
Deferred tax related to assets 
and liabilities arising from a Single 
Transaction – Amendments to LKAS 12
The amendments to LKAS 12 Income Tax 
narrow the scope of the initial recognition 
exception, so that it no longer applies to

The Board of Directors has overall 
responsibility for the establishment and 
oversight of the Group’s risk management 
framework.
The Group’s risk management processes 
are established to identify and analyse the 
risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate 
risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks 
and adherence to limits. Risk management 
systems are reviewed regularly to reflect 
changes in market conditions and the group 
activities.
The Audit Committee oversees how 
management monitors compliance with 
the Group’s risk management processes/
guidelines and procedures, and reviews 
the adequacy of the risk management 
framework in relation to the risks. The Audit 
Committee is assisted in its oversight role 
by internal reviews of risk management 
controls and procedures. The results of 
which are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Group has exposure to the following risks 
from its use of financial instruments:
– Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk
This note presents information about the 
Group’s exposure to each of the above 
risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for measuring and managing 
risk and the Group’s management of 
capital. Further quantitative disclosures 
are included throughout these Financial 
Statements. 
4.1. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to 
the Group if a customer or counterparty 
to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligation, and arise principally 
from the Group’s receivables from customers.
Carrying amount of financial assets represents 
the maximum credit exposure

4.1.1 Trade receivables
To reduce credit risk, the Group has a 
well-established credit policy for both 
domestic and international interconnect 
customers. A separate committee has been 
established to assess and recommend 
the creditworthiness of the International 
Interconnect customer. Furthermore, prepaid 
sales are used to mitigate credit risk.
Domestic service is only offered to new 
customers after they have been screened 
through an internal blacklist database. The 
Group has a well-established credit control 

policy and process in place to reduce credit 
risk. Customers are divided into segments, 
and their credit limit is determined by the 
average monthly bill value. Customer usage 
and bill payments are monitored based on the 
credit limit. The credit limit will be adjusted 
periodically based on the previous month’s 
bill value. When high-risk voice customers 
reach the threshold limit, their service is 
automatically disconnected. Credit control 
and recovery actions are taken for overdue 
and defaulted customers to reduce credit 
risk. Customers with high revenue, including 
corporate customers, are individually 
monitored.

4.1.2 Other investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by 
investing only in Government Debt Securities, 
Repos and in short-term deposits with 
selected bankers with Board approval.
4.1.3 Cash and cash equivalents
The Group held cash and cash equivalents 
of LKR 12,377 Mn. as at 31 December 2023 
(2022 LKR. 14,150 Mn.) 
4.1.4 Employee loans
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk 
by ensuring the loan balance are recovered 
from the employees monthly salary, or if the 
employee leaves such amounts are recovered 
from the employees EPF balance.


4.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will 
encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations 
associated with its financial liabilities that are 
settled by delivering cash or another financial 
asset. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that 
it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet 
its liabilities when due, under both normal 
and stressed conditions, without incurring 
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the 
Group’s reputation.
The group ensures its liquidity is maintained 
by investing in short, medium and long-term 
financial instruments to support operational 
and other funding requirements. The group


determines its liquidity requirements by 
the use of both short and long-term cash 
forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented 
by a financial headroom analysis which is used 
to assess funding adequacy for at least a 
12-month period and the same is reviewed on 
an annual basis. 
Short and medium-term requirements are 
regularly reviewed and managed by the 
Treasury Division.

of LKR 200 Mn. (2022-LKR 200 Mn.) for

4.3 Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices which will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures 
within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. 
4.3.1 Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on services provided, services received and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the 
Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) 
The Group manages its currency risk by a natural hedging mechanism to a certain extent by matching currency outflows for repayments of foreign 
currency loans and services with currency inflows for services settled in foreign currencies.
Further SLT uses forward bookings where necessary to mitigate their foreign currency exposure in a prudent manner.
The summary of quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to foreign currency was as follows:

4.3.2 Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk mainly arises as a result of Group having interest sensitive assets and liabilities, which are directly, impacted by changes in the interest 
rates. The Group’s borrowings and investments are maintained in a mix of fixed and variable interest rate instruments and periodical maturity gap 
analysis is carried out to take timely action and to mitigate possible adverse impact due to volatility of the interest rates.
Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operations while long-term interest rate management decisions require approval 
from the board of Directors.
Interest rate sensitivity of the company was computed within the floor interest rate (Minimum) of 2.5% as stipulated in the loan agreement. The 
Group interest rate sensitivity was computed based on a 100 basis point increase or decrease. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in 
particular, foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. The sensitivity of interest rate movement is shown below:

13. Property, Plant and Equipment (Contd...)


(a) On 1 September 1991, the 
Department of Telecommunications 
(DoT) transferred its entire 
telecommunications business and 
related assets and liabilities to SLT. A 
valuation of the assets and liabilities 
transferred to SLT was performed by 
the Government of Sri Lanka. The net 
amount of those assets and liabilities 
represents SLT’s Contributed Capital on 
incorporation and the value of property, 
plant and equipment as determined by 
the Government of Sri Lanka. Valuers 
were used to determine the opening 
cost of fixed assets on 01 September 
1991 in the first statutory accounts 
of SLT. Further, SLT was converted 
into a public limited company, 
Sri Lanka Telecom Limited (SLTL), on 
25 September 1996 and on that date, 
all business and the related assets and 
liabilities of SLT were transferred to SLTL 
as part of the privatisation process.
(b) The cost of fully depreciated assets 
still in use in the company as at 
31 December 2023 was LKR 152,423, Mn. 
(2022 - LKR 155,164 Mn.). The cost of 
fully depreciated assets still in use in the

(e) All the motor vehicles have been 
insured. SLT has obtained Property 
All Risk Insurance with effect from 
31 March 2022 for targeted assets 
of SLT at island wide locations. An 
insurance reserve has been created 
together with a sinking fund investment 
to meet any potential losses with 
regard to uninsured property, plant 
and equipment. At the reporting date, 
the insurance reserve amounted to 
LKR 300 Mn. (2022 - LKR 300 Mn.) 
(Note 28).
(f) Impairment of assets mainly consists 
of the carrying value of LTE Assets 
LKR 320 Mn., IT Systems LKR 69 Mn. 
and IPTV assets LKR 91 Mn. (2022 
- LKR 304 Mn. on LTE Assets and 
LKR 5 Mn. on CDMA towers). The 
impaired assets are related to the fixed 
telephony operations segment. The 
recoverable amount of these assets was 
computed based on the Value-In-Use 
method at a discount rate of 12% (2022 

#!--

- 19.50%). These impairment losses 
are included under the administrative 
expenses in the Statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income. 
(g) The capital work-in-progress related 
to network equipment of the Group is 
LKR 22,209 Mn. (2022 - LKR 22,959 Mn.)

LKR 3,961Mn.).
(i) The carrying value of network assets of 
the Group is LKR 119,222 Mn. (2022 - 
LKR 108,144 Mn.) and the Company is 
LKR 87,566 Mn. (2022 - LKR 75,338 Mn.).
(j) The depreciation charge on network 
assets of the Group is LKR 20,332 Mn. 
(2022 - LKR 19,303 Mn.) and the Company 
is LKR 14,647 Mn. (2022- LKR 13,618 Mn.).
